{"abstractText":"1. T antigens of group A hemolytic streptococci have been obtained in soluble form by digestion of the bacterial cells with pepsin or trypsin. Large quantities of this antigen were readily extracted from type 1 strains, whereas only small amounts could be obtained from strains of other types. 2. The T antigen, prepared in this way from a type 1 strain, was partially purified by chemical precipitation and further enzymatic digestion. An active fraction, apparently protein in nature, was separated electrophoretically at pH 7.00. The separated material, pooled and analyzed at the same pH, gave only a single peak. The isoelectric point of this substance was about pH 4.50. An elementary analysis was obtained. Although the T antigen was resistant to digestion with proteolytic enzymes and ribonuclease, it was readily inactivated by heat, especially in acid media and in strong salt solutions. The serological activity of this purified T substance was lost after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. 3. Analysis by means of the ultracentrifuge showed that the material was polydisperse and therefore probably impure. 4. The soluble form of the T substance was active in the precipitin reaction, in the fixation of complement, in inhibition of T agglutination, and as an antigen when injected into rabbits. The antibodies produced did not protect mice against infection with virulent strains of hemolytic streptococci containing the same T antigen. 5. The immunological specificity of T antigen in soluble form is the same as that of the T antigen in the intact streptococcus from which it was derived.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Antibodies","Antigens","Immunity","Streptococcal Infections","Streptococcus"],"pmid":"19871581","title":"THE PROPERTIES OF T ANTIGENS EXTRACTED FROM GROUP A HEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCI.","year":"1946"},

Ca(++), Ni(++), and Co(++) are less effective than Mg(++). The hemolytic system usually does not contain sufficient Mg(++) for optimal hemolytic activity so that a marked enhancement can be obtained by addition of extra Mg(++). 2. The enhancing action of tissue fluids can be ascribed to their contribution of Mg(++). 3. Substances which bind Mg(++) and Ca(++) are anticomplementary when added to the usual hemolytic system which contains only a small quantity of Mg(++). This type of anticomplementary effect can be overcome by addition of extra Mg(++). 4.

{"abstractText":"Repeated determinations of the circulation time by the fluorescein method were made in normal and shocked dogs. In normal animals the circulation time ranges from 9 to 16 seconds with an average of 12.6 seconds. In traumatic shock the circulation time is invariably prolonged. For prognosis in the traumatized animal two determinations of fluorescein circulation time separated by an interval of 1 hour are essential. If the second circulation time is longer than the first and both are over 30 seconds, the animal will not survive without therapy. On the other hand, if the second circulation time is below 25 seconds or is considerably shorter than the first, the prognosis is good. In many of these experiments the change in circulation time appeared to be the earliest index of eventual recovery or death. It gave a clue to the fate of the animal when no decisive judgment could be made from the blood pressure and heart rate. In three dogs the cyanide and fluorescein circulation times were compared during shock. It was found that the cyanide circulation time, though increased in shock, remained at a fairly constant value while over the same period the fluorescein circulation time showed progressive changes. This discrepancy between the cyanide and fluorescein methods may be explained by the fact that the former does not include the minute peripheral systemic circulation. Since the study of shock is concerned with tissue anoxia and is primarily a phenomenon of the failure of the peripheral circulation, it is important to choose procedures such as the fluorescein method as a measure of the condition of the peripheral vascular system.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Hemolysis","Ions","Magnesium"],"pmid":"19871587","title":"FLUORESCEIN CIRCULATION TIME AS A PROGNOSTIC SIGN IN EXPERIMENTAL TRAUMATIC SHOCK.","year":"1946"},
{"abstractText":"Intracerebral injection of preparations of influenza viruses into mice led to tonic and clonic convulsions and death in tetanus, usually within 24 to 72 hours. Histological examination revealed the destruction of the ependymal lining of the ventricles as the dominant finding. These reactions were obtained in four different strains of mice as well as in rats, guinea pigs, and hamsters. They were observed in mice after injection of mouse and egg-adapted virus, and all strains of virus tested gave these responses as long as sufficient quantities of the agents were injected. Control materials, such as normal allantoic fluids, particulate components of normal chorio-allantoic membranes, and suspensions of normal murine lungs, gave uniformly negative results. Activation of a latent virus as well as the inadvertent admixture of a neurotropic agent to the influenza cultures was excluded. Propagation of the influenza viruses in the central nervous system could not be demonstrated and, in fact, the agents were no longer demonstrable in 4 days. It was concluded that the observed neurological reactions were the result of toxic activities rather than of virus propagation. Comparison between the infectivity, hemagglutinating capacity, and the toxic activity showed that preparations with the higher titers of virus and hemagglutinin were also the more toxic ones. The toxic agents could not be separated from the infectious particles by the use of such technics as differential high speed centrifugation, adsorption onto and elution from chicken red cells, and precipitation by protamine. The toxic effect of influenza A virus preparations was specifically neutralized by anti-influenza A and not by anti-influenza B serum, and conversely. In addition, antigenic differences were noted between two strains of influenza A virus by this method of testing.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"19871592","title":"STUDIES ON THE TOXICITY OF INFLUENZA VIRUSES : I.

{"abstractText":"Upon intra-abdominal or intravenous injection of allantoic fluids infected with influenza viruses, mice frequently died within 8 to 96 hours. Similar results were observed upon injection of rabbits, rats, and guinea pigs. Autopsy of the mice revealed widespread necrosis of liver and spleen, hemorrhages into the intestines, pleural exudation, and other occasional findings. Survivors frequently developed pulmonary consolidation or jaundice. The dominant type of lesion depended on the strain of virus used. All attempts to demonstrate propagation of the influenza viruses outside of the respiratory tract failed. It was concluded that the early lesions were the result of toxic activities of the virus and not of virus multiplication in the affected tissues. Injection into chick embryos of highly diluted inocula produced higher titers of virus, hemagglutmin, and toxicity in the allantoic fluids than the use of more concentrated seed culture. Serial passage of various strains in high dilution frequently increased the toxic activity. The infectivity often reached its peak in 24 hours when tests for toxicity were still negative. Maximal toxicity was usually not attained before 48 hours. The toxic activity could not be separated from the infective property by such means as differential centrifugation and adsorption onto and elution from chicken red cells. However, upon heating, formalinization, and irradiation with ultraviolet light, the ability of the agents to propagate was lost at a faster rate than the toxic property. The toxic property remained stable for 2 to 3 months at 4 degrees C. This stability was comparable to that of the infectivity for chick embryos. Specific immune sera neutralized in high dilution the toxic activity of the homologous virus. Non-specific neutralization occurred in low dilutions of normal and heterologous immune sera. Strain differences were indicated by this method of testing. Vaccination of mice by the subcutaneous or intra-abdominal routes protected mice specifically against the toxic effects of intra-abdominally or intravenously injected preparations of virus.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"19871593","title":"STUDIES ON THE TOXICITY OF INFLUENZA VIRUSES : II.

{"abstractText":"Constriction of inferior vena cava above the diaphragm is used to produce experimental ascites in the dog. This type of experimental ascites drains the body protein reserves, reduces the level of circulating plasma proteins, and in effect is an internal plasmapheresis. As the ascitic fluid is withdrawn and the proteins measured, we observe a production of ascitic protein (80-90 gm. per week) comparable to that removed by plasmapheresis (bleeding and replacement of red cells in saline). High protein diet tends to decrease the ascites but the protein content of the ascitic fluid may increase. Sodium chloride increases notably the volume of the ascites which accumulates and the total ascitic protein output increases. Sodium-free salt mixtures have a negative influence. High protein diet low in sodium salts gives minimal ascitic accumulation under these conditions.

{"abstractText":"Evidence is presented on the occurrence of spontaneous hypertension in dogs. All dogs with spontaneous hypertension exhibited normal renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. Clearances on nephrogenic hypertensive dogs revealed that some exhibited normal kidney function, while others had significant depression of renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. In the latter, the filtration fraction may or may not be elevated. Serial renal clearances were done at intervals on 3 dogs with spontaneous hypertension during their 3rd year of known hypertension. They exhibited no tendency to develop impaired renal function in the face of prolonged benign hypertension. Serial renal clearances on nephrogenic hypertensive dogs revealed no tendency for kidney function to become progressively impaired. This was true, whether the immediate postoperative clearance values were normal or depressed. It was also true regardless of the duration of the hypertension. It is suggested that mechanisms other than elevated blood pressure per se operate to produce progressive kidney damage and impairment of renal function. No tendency was revealed over the course of a year or more for the kidney function to improve in Goldblatt dogs exhibiting depressed clearances immediately postoperatively. This is interpreted as evidence against the postoperative development in persistently hypertensive Goldblatt dogs of a renal collateral circulation sufficient to augment significantly effective renal blood flow. Pathological studies on 2 dogs with spontaneous hypertension revealed slight to moderate chronic focal lesions in the kidneys, and bilateral adrenal cortical adenomatous hyperplasia. Both lesions may have no pathogenetic significance. In accord with previous observations, autopsies on 3 Goldblatt dogs revealed minimal renal changes in one, and unilateral kidney atrophy with contralateral hypertrophy in the 2 others. The adrenals were normal. In general, data on renal clearances showed correlation with postmortem kidney findings. However, normal renal clearances are found in the presence of anatomically abnormal kidneys. The findings in canine spontaneous and nephrogenic hypertension are compared and contrasted with data obtained in human essential hypertension.

{"abstractText":"Podophyllotoxin, 10(-3) (M), inhibits the respiration in vitro of rat lymph nodes, thymus, kidney, tumor, spleen, liver, brain, testis, and chicken embryo. Lymph node and spleen respiration are most sensitive, and the degree of inhibition increases with time. The injection of podophyllotoxin into tumor-bearing mice (20 mg. per kg.) causes a dramatic reduction in the respiration of tumor slices. Within 6 hours, the respiration approaches zero. Inhibition is evident 2 hours after injection of the drug. Spleen respiration is reduced 50 per cent within 6 hours. Kidney and liver respirations remain within normal limits. Marked reductions in the respiration of spleen, lymph nodes, and thymus glands of normal rats are produced by the injection of 15 mg. per kg. Thymus gland is the most sensitive of these three tissues, and its respiration is reduced 66 per cent 24 hours after injection of the drug. The injection of 0.8 microgram podophyllotoxin into the yolk sac of chicken eggs bearing 5 day embryos has no effect on the respiration of the embryo within 8 hours, although this is a sufficiently toxic dose to kill 80 per cent of the embryos (within 24 hours). Kidney respiration in the presence of acetate, glucose, alanine, and glutamate is inhibited to approximately the same degree as in the absence of added substrate. Succinate and pyruvate oxidation by rat kidney slices appear to be less sensitive. Oxidation of acetate and butyrate by rabbit kidney homogenate is more sensitive to podophyllotoxin than oxidation by rabbit kidney homogenate without added substrate. Glucose oxidation by this preparation is not inhibited by 10(-3)M podophyllotoxin. The anaerobic glycolysis of chicken embryo, rat brain, and rat testis is stimulated by 10(-5) and 10(-6)M podophyllotoxin, and is inhibited by 10(-3)M. The following enzymes are not inhibited by 10(-3)M podophyllotoxin: succinoxidase from pigeon breast muscle, choline, xanthine and tyrosine oxidase from rat liver homogenate, and leucine oxidase from Proteus vulgaris; alkaline and acid phosphatase from dog serum; adenosine triphosphatase from rat liver; choline esterase from rat brain homogenate; ribonucleodepolymerase from spleen mince and thymonucleodepolymerase from dog serum.

{"abstractText":"Acute pneumococcic lymphadenitis produced in rats by intradermal inoculation of the foot-pad is characterized by rapid infiltration of polymorphonuclear leucocytes into the intermediary sinuses of the node, and prompt phagocytosis of pneumococci by both the macrophages of the sinuses and the recently arrived leucocytes. After 5 to 7 hours the polymorphonuclear leucocytes are found densely congregated about the hilar region, and 9 hours after inoculation most of the phagocyted organisms have been digested. At the end of the 24 hour period the popliteal node presents the picture of a subsiding inflammation with a marked macrophage reaction and regenerating lymph follicles. Phagocytosis of encapsulated pneumococci in the foot-pad and popliteal node occurs in less than 30 minutes after inoculation. It is assumed that this prompt phagocytosis is effected by the non-antibody mechanism of \"surface phagocytosis.\" The majority of polymorphonuclear leucocytes that enter the sinuses of the inflamed node appear to come from capillaries within the node itself rather than from the primary site of inflammation in the foot-pad. The prompt inflammatory response of the nodal tissues serves as an active defense against lymph-borne infection. Macrophages invade nodal sinuses only after most of the pneumococci have been destroyed by polymorphonuclear leucocytes. It is suggested that the macrophage reaction follows removal of the primary inflammatory stimulus by the granulocytes, and thus constitutes only a late phase of recovery. Fibrin formation in the sinuses of the lymph node is rare during acute lymphadenitis. This finding may be related to the observation that within 5 minutes after entrance of bacteria into the node, heparin-containing granules from mast cells are strewn throughout the sinuses.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Lymph Nodes"],"pmid":"15394073","title":"Cellular mechanisms of antibacterial defense in lymph nodes; pathogenesis of acute bacterial lymphadenitis.","year":"1949"},

{"abstractText":"Five groups of 10 rabbits each were injected intravenously 2 times at 15 day intervals with either whole horse serum or one of its cold alcohol-precipitated fractions. Suitable serological and general observations were made at appropriate intervals before and after each injection. All animals were sacrificed on the 22nd day of the experiment. A study of the antemortem and pathological findings led to the following conclusions. 1. Allergie arteritis, valvulitis, and to a lesser degree, focal pericarditis, Aschoff-like nodules, and glomerulitis can be produced by several of the cold alcohol-precipitated fractions of horse serum as well as by whole serum. 2. Most of the acute arteritis was seen in rabbits receiving fraction V (albumin). These rabbits showed the largest amounts of circulating antigen, low antibody titers, low tissue sensitivity, and slight elevation in sedimentation rate and temperature. 3. There was a high incidence of chronic arteritis in the rabbits receiving fraction III which is almost devoid of albumin, suggesting that the alpha and beta globulins in addition to albumin may produce arteritis. 4. A state most nearly resembling that of acute rheumatic fever was produced by either fractions III or IV-3,4 (alpha and beta globulins).

{"abstractText":"Repeated intraperitoneal injections twice daily of various proteins into young rats were regularly accompanied by an increase in the protein content of the urine, significant renal enlargement, and often some degree of renal pallor. The most marked changes were induced by gelatin, followed in order by human albumin and bovine globulin. Rat serum produced similar but less conclusive changes. Similar changes were not produced by equivalent amounts of urea or casein hydrolysate. In sections from the kidneys of animals receiving gelatin, the cells of the convoluted tubules appeared enlarged, and they contained clear \"spaces\" throughout the cytoplasm. The tubular cells of the animals receiving the other solutions were not obviously altered in size or shape, and the cytoplasmic changes were slight or absent. There was little evidence of increased multiplication of cells or of tubular dilatation in the kidneys of any of the groups. Changes in concentrations of plasma proteins and hemoglobin, and the results of preliminary studies of the injected proteins in urine and renal tissue following the injections, are described and their possible significance discussed. It appears that the renal enlargement, as well as the increase in proteinuria and the tubular alterations which followed the protein injections, might have been caused in part by effects on the kidney of protein molecules per se, perhaps most likely by the effects on the tubular cells of an increased amount of protein filtered through the glomerular membranes, rather than entirely by effects of products of protein digestion and metabolism reaching the kidney through the blood stream. In the majority of animals there was no evidence from the morphological or functional studies, that the prolonged and continuous proteinuria induced by the protein injections resulted in renal damage, unless the renal enlargement, and the cytoplasmic changes which occurred regularly with gelatin, are considered evidence of damage. Renal enlargement and proteinuria promptly regressed after injections were discontinued. Lesions characterized by severe degrees of tubular damage, possibly as a result of tubular plugging, were observed in some of the animals of one group receiving gelatin solution of the usual concentration, and dilatation of renal tubules and glomerular capsules was present in some other gelatin-treated animals autopsied after relatively brief injection periods. A description is also presented of lesions of remarkable character which developed in the kidneys of all the animals of one small group receiving homologous serum obtained from severely anoxic donors.

{"abstractText":"Electron microscope examination of fragmented elastic tissue obtained from fish swim bladder, bovine ligamentum nuchae, and aortas of various mammals, including man, reveals characteristically formed fibers and much amorphous material. Boiling in dilute acid destroys the associated collagen but does not obviously alter the elastic tissue. Digestion in crystalline trypsin of either boiled or unheated tissue from any of the above-mentioned sources causes the release of thin threads ranging in length from 0.1 micro to many microns. A large proportion of these threads are evenly and tightly coiled double helices formed from at least two interlacing filaments and measuring about 120 A in width. The distance between coils ranges from about 470 to 590 A. The individual smooth filaments, many of which are present in parallel pairs, measure approximately 70 A in width. Raising the pH of a neutral suspension of threads from ligamentum nuchae lowers the ratio of helical threads to uncoiled filaments, whereas lowering the pH with acetic acid results in clumping of threads with complete loss of identity at about pH 3.6. Threads and filaments obtained from all sources studied were destroyed in the temperature range 75-85 degrees C. at pH 7.

{"abstractText":"Suspensions of yolk sac infected with rickettsiae of murine or of epidemic typhus, and indeed suspensions of liver or peritoneal washings from cotton rats infected with these organisms, when the suspensions contain a sufficient concentration of living rickettsiae, possess the capacity to hemolyze, in vitro, red cells of rabbit or sheep origin. Under the same conditions such material did not cause the hemolysis of cells from mice, cotton rats, or guinea pigs. Yolk sac and tissue suspensions of R. orientalis (Karp, Raub, and Gilliam strains) failed to hemolyze rabbit cells. The hemolytic principle was destroyed by formol (0.5 per cent) and by heating to 56 degrees C. for 1 hour. The close association of the \"hemolysin\" with the rickettsiae was indicated by their parallel movements on centrifugation and by the close parallel demonstrated between the effects produced on hemolytic activity and on such manifestations of the presence of living rickettsiae as toxicity for mice and lethality or total infectivity for cotton rats when infected yolk sac suspensions were exposed to elevated temperature or were concentrated by high-speed centrifugation. The mechanism of hemolysis remains ill defined. It progresses slowly, but never to completion (i.e. hemolysis of all the cells in the substrate) even when the number of such cells is small. This may be because hemolysis progresses best at temperatures (+\/-35 degrees C.) which are unfavorable to the hemolytic principle and because erythrocytes vary in their susceptibility to the injurious agent. The concentration of red cells also may be a determining factor, either by affecting the rate at which the reaction proceeds or by aiding in the preservation of hemolytic activity. Although it was impossible to separate the \"hemolysin\" from the rickettsiae, examination of smear preparations of hemolyzing mixtures showed no consistent contact relation between cells and rickettsiae. Adsorption experiments revealed that, while removal of the cells from the hemolytic system did not reduce the hemolyzing capacity of the system, the cells carried away a significant tendency to hemolyze. It is suggested that the rate at which injury is inflicted on the red cells is dependent on the concentration of \"hemolysin\" present and that the process may proceed in the relative absence of rickettsiae once sufficient damage has been inflicted. The toxicity of richly infected yolk sac suspensions for intravenously inoculated mice was found to be related, not to in vivo hemolysis, but apparently to a serious alteration in vascular permeability which caused a marked reduction in blood volume. This was evidenced by an increased concentration of red cells but not of plasma proteins. It is possible, but has not been demonstrated, that the factor responsible for altering vascular permeability of mice may be identical with that which causes lysis of rabbit and sheep cells. Two applications of the phenomenon of in vitro hemolysis are indicated. Following the technique described in the text for the optimum demonstration of hemolysis, the determination of the degree of hemolytic activity may serve as a rapid, roughly quantitative in vitro method for assessing the infectivity of a newly made rickettsial preparation. The phenomenon also is the basis for an additional, and potentially useful in vitro serologic technique which differs from other techniques in that it depends on a property of living rickettsiae. It has been shown that homologous antisera are capable of inhibiting hemolysis, and optimum conditions for demonstrating this inhibitory effect are described.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Rickettsia"],"pmid":"18871875","title":"The phenomenon of in vitro hemolysis produced by the rickettsiae of typhus fever, with a note on the mechanism of rickettsial toxicity in mice.","year":"1948"},

Antibodies to the soluble or S antigen appear earlier in the disease and, as a rule, reach high levels before antibodies against the virus-bound or V antigen commence to rise. In early convalescence, both antibodies reach high levels. Subsequently antibodies against the S antigen decrease usually at a faster rate than those against V, so that after a period of several years, frequently only anti-V may be left. These findings were found helpful in diagnostic procedures. The use of both the V and S antigens has permitted the early diagnosis of manifestations of mumps in the absence of parotitis, such as meningoencephalitis, since the finding of high levels of anti-S and of low titers of, or no, anti-V is considered diagnostically significant for the first few days of illness. For the determination of resistance the use of the V antigen appears more useful. Following vaccination or skin testing, antibodies against both antigens may develop; those against V increase more regularly and to higher titers than those against S.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Antibodies","Antigens"],"pmid":"18871883","title":"The reactivity of various human sera with mumps complement fixation antigens.","year":"1948"},

This phenomenon has been studied in relation to certain in vitro properties of these viruses. Saline suspensions of virus prepared by centrifugation or elution from chicken erythrocytes produced fever. Fluids from which most of the virus particles had been removed were non-pyrogenic. Exposure to temperatures which destroyed the infectivity of the virus for chick embryos did not prevent fever. However, heating sufficient to destroy the hemagglutinin also rendered virus non-pyrogenic. The injection of erythrocytes onto which virus had been adsorbed produced fever. Heated virus adsorbed onto erythrocytes, which failed to elute, produced no elevation of temperature, although heated virus alone was pyrogenic. Neutralization of virus with specific immune serum prevented fever. Antipyrine was capable of abolishing the febrile response to virus. Certain differences between the febrile response in rabbits to the injection of viruses and that following bacterial pyrogens were noted. The period between injection and beginning of temperature rise is longer with virus than with bacterial pyrogens. Relatively low temperatures inactivate the fever-producing capacity of viruses, whereas bacterial pyrogens withstand prolonged autoclaving, and the neutralization of viral fever by specific immune serum contrasts sharply with the failure of antibody to affect the response to bacterial pyrogens.

By the proper addition of salts the rate of attachment can be adjusted to any desired value up to the maximum limit set by the diffusion rate of the virus. Salts of Ca(++), Mg(++), Ba(++), and Mn(++) bring about a reaction rate representing 100 per cent collision efficiency in a concentration of 5 x 10(-4)M. Both greater and smaller concentrations depress the attachment velocity. Salts of Na(+), K(+), NH(4) (+), and Li(+) display a similar pattern but require a tenfold greater concentration than that of the previous group to produce the same effect. Moreover, the maximum velocity attainable in solutions containing only monovalent cations is only half that achieved by the divalent salts. The trivalent cations Al(3+), Cr(3+), Fe(3+) permanently inactivate the virus. Activation by Mg(++) of an inert mixture of virus and host cells in distilled water is so rapid as to be beyond the limit of the resolving time of the experimental procedure, which is 20 seconds. The temperature dependence curve of virus-cell adsorption exhibits a maximum at 37 degrees C. and falls to a value representing approximately 3 per cent collision efficiency at 1 degrees C. Identical curves are obtained in nutrient broth and in 10(-)M MgCl(2) solution. Bacteriophage can be quantitatively adsorbed on to glass filters. In a study of several viruses this attachment reaction was found to require the same cofactors-both organic, like ltryptophane, as well as inorganic-which each specific virus required for its attachment to its host cell. The suggestion is made that the attachment of viruses to these filters is a useful model for their attachment to host cells. Virus attachment to glass filters is reversible. Such adsorbed virus can be recovered almost quantitatively by washing the filter with a solution in which the attachment reaction does not occur. Virus attachment to host cells is similarly reversible at least in its primary step. Distilled water at 0 degrees C. can produce almost complete liberation of T2 virus from host cells infected in 0.02 M NaCl solution. Two significant differences between the behavior of glass filters and host cells toward T1 virus are: (a) an excess ion concentration fails to inhibit virus attachment to the glass as it does to the host cell; and (b) no decrease in efficiency of attachment to glass occurs at low temperatures. These facts suggest that the inhibiting action on the infective process of excess cations and low temperatures involves chemical groupings on the cell surface, rather than on the virus. There is no detectable attachment whatever of T1 virus to E. coli cells specifically resistant to it, though still susceptible to other viruses. This experiment indicates that the ion-controlled attachment forces here considered are involved in the host-virus specificity. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that several different viruses with different host-cell specificities have different ionic requirements for cell attachment. All of these observations lend themselves to explanation by a mechanism which pictures an initial addition reaction of cations to specific sites on the surface of the virus in particular, and possibly also of the host cell. Two complementary electrostatic configurations are so produced which can unite in a reaction with a high biological specificity, which yet exhibits 100 per cent collision efficiency. An excess of ions may cover up some of the attachment sites and so inhibit the reaction. By this picture the specificity of virus-cell invasion depends upon the binding energies of sites on both bodies for various ions, and the distribution of these sites over the two surfaces. Possible relationships of such a process to other biological systems are discussed.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Ions","Viruses"],"pmid":"14803632","title":"The mechanism of virus attachment to host cells.

Splenin A has the same action on fibrinolysin inactivation as ACTH or cortisone. Splenin B has the opposite effect. This action on the antifibrinolytic power of serum appears to be due to an acceleration of the rate of combination between the enzyme and its inhibitor and not to an actual increase in antifibrinolysin. The possible significance of these observations is discussed.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Blood"],"pmid":"14803633","title":"Studies on the fibrinolysin-antifibrinolysin system in serum.

{"abstractText":"An abrupt decrease in the titer of serum T-agglutinin frequently occurs during the acute phase of anthrax infection in the rabbit. In partially immunized animals which survive the infection the titer returns to normal during convalescence, but has not been observed to rise significantly above the normal level. The presence of a substance capable of inhibiting T-agglutination may be demonstrated in the sera of many of those animals in which a marked decrease in T-agglutinin has occurred. The polysaccharide and polypeptide antigens of B. anthracis do not possess this activity. Sera containing the T-inhibitory substance usually produce a slow hemolysis of T-erythrocytes and also of normal human type O erythrocytes; hemolysis of erythrocytes of other species is irregular. This reactivity of the sera withstands inactivation at 56 degrees C. but is inhibited by citrate. T-inhibitory and hemolytic activities can frequently be increased by incubation of the acute-phase serum at 37 degrees C.

{"abstractText":"The filarial worm, Litomosoides carinii, has a high rate of aerobic and anaerobic glucose metabolism. Aerobically 30 to 45 per cent of the glucose utilized was converted to lactic acid, 25 to 35 per cent to acetic acid, and 10 to 20 per cent to a polysaccharide. Anaerobically over 80 per cent of the total carbohydrate removed by the filariae was metabolized to lactic acid, the remainder was accounted for by the production of acetic acid. The high rates of aerobic and anaerobic lactic acid production and of aerobic polysaccharide synthesis, as well as the absence of a postanaerobic increase of the oxygen uptake, differentiate the filarial worm, L. carinii, from the known metabolic characteristics of all other helminths and of most other invertebrates. The rate of aerobic lactate and pyruvate utilization by the filariae appears to be much slower than that of glucose. Anaerobically, dismutation of two moles of pyruvate to one mole of lactate, one mole of acetate, and one mole of CO(2), occurred. Aerobically, acetate production from pyruvate exceeded that of lactate. A significant proportion of the pyruvate metabolized aerobically by the filariae was not oxidized to acetate. In the presence of fluoroacetate, aerobic incubation of the filariae in a glucose-containing medium produced a marked decrease in the respiration of the organisms, an accumulation of pyruvate, a decreased formation of acetate, and an increase in aerobic glycolysis. Low concentrations of fluoroacetate (1 x 10(-3)M) inhibited the oxidative metabolism of pyruvate which did not result in the conversion of pyruvate to acetate; higher concentrations of this inhibitor produced also a decreased oxidation of pyruvate to acetate. No evidence has been obtained that fluoroacetate inhibits the respiration of the filariae because of a competitive inhibition of acetate oxidation. Respiration and glycolysis of filariae were markedly decreased by low concentrations of p-chloromercuric benzoate. This inhibition could not be reversed by a large excess of thioglycollate, cystein, glutathione, or H(2)S. Respiration of the filariae was completely inhibited by cyanide (2 x 10(-4)M). The cyanine dyes, a group of compounds possessing high chemotherapeutic activity in filariasis of the cotton rat, inhibited in low concentrations (6.5 x 10(-8)M) the oxygen uptake of the filarial worms. This decrease in oxidative metabolism was associated with a compensatory increase in aerobic glycolysis of the worms and with decreased rates of acetate production and of polysaccharide synthesis. The same metabolic changes were observed in filariae removed from cotton rats to which subcurative doses of a cyanine dye had been administered. Concentrations of cyanine dyes which produced an almost complete inhibition of filarial respiration had no effect on the rate of anaerobic glycolysis of the worms nor on the activity of cytochrome C or of cytochrome oxidase. It is concluded that, in contrast to many other parasitic invertebrates, oxidative metabolism is essential for the survival of the filarial worm, L. carinii, and that the chemotherapeutic activity of the cyanine dyes in filariasis of the cotton rat is due to the inhibitory effect of this group of compounds on the respiratory metabolism of the parasite.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Filarioidea"],"pmid":"18099168","title":"Studies on the metabolism of the filarial worm, Litomosoides carinii.","year":"1949"},

Temperature has a marked effect on the rate of appearance of toxin, the critical thermal increment having a value of approximately 36,000. The formation of streptolysin S is inhibited by mercuric ion, arsenite, iodoacetate, dinitrophenol, azide, and other enzyme poisons.

An extremely diffusible dye, echt-säure-blau, has also been coupled to bovine gamma-globulin. These materials are adapted to physiological experimentation. They seem to behave in the bodies of mice like other proteins; they fail to appear in either the bile or urine of normal animals, and they are strongly antigenic. When these soluble antigenic azoproteins are injected into the blood stream of mice for the first time they enter reticulo-endothelial cells in almost every organ of the body; the final distribution is like that of intravenously injected, finely divided particulate matter. The azoproteins appear in the cells which classical immunological studies have shown to be active in removing particulate antigenic materials or bacteria from the blood or body fluids. The Kupffer cells of the liver and sinus and reticular cells in lymph nodes, especially the great mesenteric node, are particularly active in the removal of the blue antigens from the blood, but many other R-E cells are active to a lesser degree. The storage of the antigenic material is in the cytoplasm only; it has not been seen within nuclei, nor has it been seen within cells of the brain. Serological methods disclose that the blue material seen within Kupffer cells of the liver after as long a period as 2 days is still antigenic in its reactions.

{"abstractText":"A study of the serum lipids in normal and alloxan-diabetic rabbits during the course of cholesterol feeding is presented, particular attention being paid to the factors considered to be responsible for the stability of the serum lipids; namely, (1) their interrelations and (2) their association with the serum proteins. As far as the interrelations of the lipids were concerned a definite correlation was found between the development of atherosclerosis and an increase of serum cholesterol that was out of all proportion to the increase of serum lipid phosphorus and neutral fat. When these last two lipid constituents rose almost parallel with the serum cholesterol (as they did in some alloxan-diabetic rabbits), then the development of atherosclerosis was inhibited. This correlation was independent of the diabetic state, per se. It appeared likely that the marked elevation of serum neutral fat and lipid phosphorus in the diabetic animals was due to mobilization of body fat because of the disturbed carbohydrate metabolism. Because of their hydrophilic and emulsifying properties, it was thought probable that the elevation of the phospholipids was the important factor responsible for the stability of serum cholesterol. That neutral fat played a role, however, could not be denied. In normal rabbit sera, as we have previously shown, only small proportions of the lipid phosphorus and cholesterol are \"readily extractable\" (i.e., unattached or only loosely attached to protein). On the other hand, in every case in which the serum lipids were elevated, the greater proportion of the lipid phosphorus and cholesterol was \"readily extractable,\" irrespective of whether atherosclerosis developed or was inhibited. Analysis of the lipid content of the aorta of rabbits not fed cholesterol, whether diabetic or non-diabetic, and from alloxan-diabetic rabbits fed cholesterol but protected from the development of atherosclerosis, showed that there was no significant difference in lipid content or composition among the animals of these groups. When atherosclerosis developed following cholesterol feeding, the lipid composition of the aortas was essentially the same in both control and diabetic animals. The deposited lipid consisted predominantly of cholesterol with small and fairly constant proportions of other lipids that did not vary significantly regardless of the quantities of these other lipids present in the circulating blood. In the less severe lesions the proportion of ester cholesterol was greater than that of free cholesterol, but in advanced lesions the reverse was true. The following conclusions are drawn concerning the pathogenesis of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis in the rabbit: 1. Instability of cholesterol in the blood rather than hypercholesterolemia, per se, is the general condition responsible for the deposition of this substance in the arterial walls. 2. Of the two factors considered to be responsible for the stability of the lipids in the blood, the interrelations of the lipids appear to be more important than their relation to the serum proteins, at least in so far as the development of experimental cholesterol atherosclerosis is concerned.

It was greater in media enriched with serum or with oleic acid-albumin complex, but was otherwise fairly independent of the composition of the medium.

The possibility that the vagina may serve as one of the portals of entry of Toxoplasma in the human being and that infection may occur by sexual contact or by contamination by feces or other Toxoplasma-containing materials is discussed. The high susceptibility of the pregnant mouse to toxoplasmosis under the conditions of these experiments suggests a possible explanation for the higher incidence of congenital as compared to postnatal human toxoplasmosis and for the associated asymptomatic maternal infection. The infected but clinically normal human mothers may be compared to some vaginally infected pregnant mice which remained symptom-free.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Toxoplasmosis","Vagina"],"pmid":"14778920","title":"Experimental congenital toxoplasmosis.

{"abstractText":"Pregnant mice infected with Toxoplasma by the vaginal route have been found to transmit toxoplasmosis to the placentas and fetuses in utero. The microorganism entered the blood stream of the mother from primary foci of infection in the vaginal wall and produced disseminated lesions in the labyrinth of the allantoic placenta at the same time as other peripheral maternal tissues were involved. Placental lesions were observed in mice infected with Toxoplasma by vagina between the 3rd and the 9th day of pregnancy. They consisted of microscopic foci of degeneration, without inflammation, in the syncytial trophoblast, and parasites undergoing multiplication were readily identified in them. Here Toxoplasma gained access to the fetal circulation. Following the vaginal instillation of Toxoplasma on the 8th day of pregnancy, subinoculation of test animals revealed the parasites in the maternal peripheral and placental blood on the 13th day and later, while the first histopathologic changes in the placenta were found on the 17th day. Toxoplasma could be demonstrated in suspensions of fetal tissues on and after the 17th day by the injection of normal test animals. However, no lesions of toxoplasmosis, or Toxoplasma, were found in histologic sections of fetuses 11 to 21 days old removed at autopsy from vaginally infected mothers. It is concluded that before birth the parasites were confined to the fetal blood. The experiments provide the first direct histological demonstration of placental toxoplasmosis. The possible bearing of the experimental disease on human placental and fetal toxoplasmosis is briefly considered. It is probable that a maternal parasitemia during the latter part of pregnancy, whatever the portal of entry may be, is an essential factor in the pathogenesis of human congenital toxoplasmosis and that this occurs shortly after exposure to Toxoplasma rather than in a later chronic stage of the infection. The suggestion is offered that some instances of spontaneous abortion or fetal death in man, as in the mouse, may be due to inapparent toxoplasmosis.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Fetus","Placenta","Toxoplasmosis"],"pmid":"14778921","title":"Experimental congenital toxoplasmosis.

{"abstractText":"A study has been made of congenital toxoplasmosis in the offspring of mice infected with Toxoplasma by the vaginal route during pregnancy. Some of the young mice were retarded in postnatal development, and some became ill or died in the 2nd to 4th weeks of life while the majority remained symptom-free in spite of the presence of toxoplasmic lesions of varying degrees of severity. Congenital toxoplasmosis developed only in offspring whose mothers had been infected on the 7th to 9th day of pregnancy. Infection of the offspring without active toxoplasmosis in the mother was not observed. The highest incidence of congenital infection (57.6 per cent) was obtained by giving 2 vaginal instillations of Toxoplasma-infected mouse brain on the 8th and 9th days of pregnancy. Mice infected before the 7th day developed placental toxoplasmosis but rarely delivered viable young. When the mother was infected after the 9th day, the offspring were normal. When congenital toxoplasmosis occurred in a litter, a majority or all of the individual offspring were usually infected. Although pathologic changes were not present in the suckling mice at birth, and did not appear before the 9th postnatal day, reasons are stated for excluding the possibility of postnatal contact or milk-borne infection. It cannot be assumed from the experimental disease that the vagina is a portal of entry of Toxoplasma in human congenital toxoplasmosis. Any route of infection leading to a maternal parasitemia during pregnancy might result in toxoplasmosis of the placenta and transmission of the disease to the offspring before birth. Unlike the restricted time interval effective in the mouse, there is a long period during the later months of pregnancy in the human being in which transplacental passage of the infection may occur. When transmission to the fetus takes place shortly before parturition, evidence of disease in the human infant, as in the mouse, may not become manifest until several weeks postpartum, and the prenatal origin of the infection may not be apparent. When the fetus becomes infected well before parturition, symptoms of congenital toxoplasmosis may be present at birth. The asymptomatic character of the infection in many of the young mice would appear to have a counterpart in certain instances of human congenital toxoplasmosis.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Toxoplasmosis"],"pmid":"14778922","title":"Experimental congenital toxoplasmosis.

{"abstractText":"The neutralization test is a reliable and useful procedure for following immunological reactions of the Coxsackie viruses (C virus). The standard procedure has been an incubation period of 1 hour at room temperature followed by subcutaneous inoculation into newborn mice. However, this time and temperature are not critical, for the virus in neutralized within 10 minutes of mixing with immune serum and remains neutralized for long periods. During the variable incubation periods used, the control virus remained active, even in dilute suspensions. The neutralization test is not affected by the presence or absence of complement. Neutralizing antibody is stable at 65 degrees C. for 30 minutes, and immune serum has to be heated to 80 degrees C. for 30 minutes before the antibody is no longer detectable. As the quantity of virus is increased, the quantity of serum required for neutralization likewise increases, but not in a regular or predictable fashion. Neutralized mixtures of the virus can be made infective again by simple dilution before inoculation. The neutralization test is a satisfactory means for typing Coxsackie viruses. At least seven antigenic types have been identified. Similar antigenic types have been found to be scattered over wide areas. Thus the Conn.-5 type was present in 1948 in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and North Carolina. The Texas-1 type was present in 1943 in Connecticut and in 1948 in North Carolina and Texas. Further information on the specificity of the neutralizing antibody response has been obtained from a study of the occurrence and development of antibodies in 6 patients who contracted infections with one or another of the C viruses while working with them in the laboratory. From each patient a virus was isolated during the illness. No patient had detectable antibodies to his strain before his illness, but each soon thereafter developed antibodies to his own strain and to the prototype strain to which it was related. By means of the neutralization test, it has been shown that a family epidemic may include two different immunological types of virus. Neutralizing antibodies appear at the time of or soon after onset of illness, increase rapidly to titers of about 1:1000 which are maintained during the period of 1 to 3 months following infection, and are still present 2 years later, although at lower levels. Neutralizing antibodies are present in the normal population. In North Carolina, over 80 per cent of the children have antibodies at birth. The level falls rapidly to a minimum of 14 per cent at the age of 1, and then it quickly rises to reach the adult level at the age of 7. Gamma globulin collected in various parts of the United States between 1944 and 1949 and in Denmark in 1949 neutralizes at least four antigenically different Coxsackie viruses.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Enterovirus"],"pmid":"14778925","title":"Immunological reactions of the Coxsackie viruses.

{"abstractText":"During the initial period following immersion of parenchymatous cells of liver, kidney, or pancreas in various fluids immediately after their removal from the body water exchange is like that which occurs when water passes by osmosis through a semipermeable membrane; intake of water is proportional to the square root of the elapsed time and when liver tissue is immersed in solutions of sodium chloride movement of water is approximately proportional to the concentration of the solution. Solutions of sodium chloride isotonic for parenchymatous cells of liver have twice the molar concentration of sodium chloride in the blood serum; for those of the kidney slightly less than twice and for those of the pancreas three times this concentration. When interstitial tissue of thymus, omentum, or pancreas is immersed in water, it undergoes edema-like swelling caused by hydration of the colloids of the fibrous tissue; quantitative water exchange in an initial period accords with water movement by osmosis and is proportional to the square root of the elapsed time. Solutions of sodium chloride isotonic for fibrous tissue of the omentum have slightly greater molar concentration than the sodium chloride in the blood serum and for that of the thymus approximately the same as that of blood serum. Sodium chloride produces changes in fibrous tissue which increase with increasing concentration its power to hold water; the dense fibrous tissue of the corium of the skin and of the wall of the aorta takes up water in both weak an strong solutions of sodium chloride. The initial movement of water induced in tissues in the period immediately following removal from the body is dependent upon forces which are active during life but soon impaired by injury to the tissues.

{"abstractText":"The present report on experimental hepatic injury is based on observations amassed during the last 9 years, comprising 1922 rats. It has been shown that there are several dietary factors which may intervene, singly or in combination, in the development of massive or zonal hepatic necrosis. Deficiency of sulfur-containing amino acids is only one of them. From the present studies, tocopherol emerges as an additional protective dietary factor. With regard to the development of massive hepatic necrosis tocopherol may compensate for the absence of sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine, methionine) and vice versa. As a further factor, the quality of dietary fat should be taken into consideration. Fats, like lard and cod liver oil, with a high content of unsaturated fatty acids enhance, whereas fats low in unsaturated fatty acids, such as crisco and butter, retard or prevent the development of massive hepatic necrosis. It is questionable whether with all these dietary factors the etiology of massive hepatic necrosis is completely defined. The interchangeability of sulfur-containing amino acids (cystine, methionine) and vitamin E as leading etiologic factors makes it difficult to accept pure deficiency as the basis of massive hepatic necrosis. The rôle of possible endogenous hepatotoxic substances and their neutralization by cystine (methionine) or tocopherol are discussed. Diffuse hepatic fibrosis is a regular occurrence in rats kept for 100 to 150 days on a diet low in lipotropic factors. Cystine, and, among the fats, lard and especially cod liver oil, have an enhancing effect on the production of hepatic cirrhosis. In rats fed rations free from cod liver oil, and with vegetable shortening such as crisco as source of fat, the incidence and severity of cirrhosis are reduced. Ceroid deposit accompanies cirrhosis only in rats which have been kept on a cirrhosis-producing diet containing fats with a high content of unsaturated fatty acids (cod liver oil, lard). Tocopherol, even when given in excessively large doses (30 mg. daily) will not prevent the formation of ceroid, and will reduce only slightly its total quantity. Under the same treatment the incidence and intensity of cirrhosis remain uninfluenced. Cellular injury in the form of degenerated or necrotic hepatic parenchymal cells, found singly or in small groups in and around the fibrous bands in the cirrhotic liver of rats, is a common occurrence. The fibrotic changes seem to begin, not in the portal spaces, but close to the central vein, although they are not as distinctly and exclusively pericentral as, for instance, in cardiac cirrhosis. Thus, experimental dietary cirrhosis is non-portal. The role of fat infiltration is discussed with special reference to the other microscopic changes found in hepatic cirrhosis. Acute necrotizing nephrosis or various stages of healing of this process are often found with great frequency in rats kept on a cirrhosis-producing diet.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Liver Diseases"],"pmid":"18107974","title":"Further observations on the production and prevention of dietary hepatic injury in rats.","year":"1949"},

As far as was determined, the elution rate of the virus appeared to be the only property which was altered.

DCA induces the production of an excessive amount of granulation tissue, as evidenced by a relatively great number of fibroblasts and by a larger amount of ground substance. This effect was accompanied by a slight to moderate lag in the maturation process of both cellular and intercellular elements. These changes were observed when DCA administration was begun 5 days prior to operation, but were less obvious or absent if DCA was injected, beginning on the 5th or 10th postoperative day. The results indicate that the action of DCA on immature, proliferating connective tissue is marked, and is considerably less or absent when connective tissue elements have reached partial or almost complete maturity. The effect of DCA on connective tissue does not appear to rest on the basis of an altered nutritional status. Chemical and histochemical studies of the adrenals suggest that the action of DCA on connective tissue is probably mediated through a disturbance of adrenocortical function, namely an imbalance between hormones of the zona glomerulosa (excess of DCA) and those of the zona fasciculata (deficiency of glucocorticoids). The presence of changes in granulation tissue and the lack of them in mature resting connective tissue of DCA-treated guinea pigs confirm the view that a profound difference in the response mechanism exists between resting and actively proliferating connective tissue.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Adrenal Cortex Hormones","Wounds and Injuries"],"pmid":"14824397","title":"Desoxycorticosterone acetate and wound healing.","year":"1951"},

{"abstractText":"The quantitative distribution of the Conn.-5 strain of Coxsackie virus in different tissues was determined by serial titration at intervals after inoculation of 4 to 5 day old mice. High titers were reached by the 2nd day in blood, heart, liver, muscle, intestine, and its contents, and these were maintained through the 8th day, except for the blood, in which the virus level fell earlier. In paralyzed mice, muscle and brain attained the highest titers and it was in these tissues alone that virus persisted through the 9th day of illness. The pathology of the infection has been briefly described. In particular, the evolution of morbid changes in striated muscle was correlated with the concentrations of virus in muscle. Acute muscle necrosis first occurred when there was a peak viral concentration (4th day), and reached maximal intensity on the 8th day. Scattered acute lesions continued to appear while the virus titer remained above 10(-4), from the 9th to 12th day. With the decrease in the myositis, there was a concomitant decrease in the incidence of perceptible disease. Inflammation was found to follow upon the development of necrosis, and subsided slowly.

The antigenic response to the CG 179 and B strains was demonstrated to be approximately equal. The neutralization test in the embryo and the hemagglutination inhibition technique yielded parallel results in the measurement of antibody early in convalescence, but late in convalescence the hemagglutination inhibition titers were relatively lower. This disparity indicates the possible duality of the antibodies. There was a wide ratio between the neutralizing antibody titers found in the brain and in the serum after an asymptomatic infection with NDV. The antibody level in the brain appeared to be related to the extent of virus growth and damage in the central nervous system. It appeared likely that a major factor in determining the virulence of the CG 179 strain was the more rapid attainment in the central nervous system of high virus concentration which outstripped the defense mechanisms of the host.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Newcastle Disease"],"pmid":"14824401","title":"The pathogenesis of infection with a virulent (CG 179) and an avirulent (B) strain of Newcastle disease virus in the chicken.

{"abstractText":"Purified lipase, injected intracerebrally and intravasculariy in rabbits, gave rise to focal areas of demyelinization in the central nervous system in 10 of 13 animals so treated. In one instance the lesions became manifest within 48 hours and in another they persisted for 6 months; they were not infrequently accompanied by paresis and by tilting or tremor of the head. They were characterized by a focal loss of myelin and moderate gliosis with little or no neuronal destruction or inflammatory reaction, in these respects resembling the plaques of multiple sclerosis. The intracerebral injection of trypsin and chymotrypsin in control animals failed to produce the characteristic demyelinization, but by contrast caused focal areas of necrosis in which all the cerebral tissues were involved. Furthermore, demyelinization did not result when heat-inactivated pancreatic lipase was injected intracerebrally, and similarly negative results were obtained when an incubated mixture comprised of fatty connective tissue that had been acted upon by the pancreatic preparation and then heated to inactivate the lipase, was injected into the brains of rabbits. In supplementary experiments the pancreatic lipase preparation and fresh rabbit brain, incubated together in vitro, were found to form acid, presumably owing to the breakdown of brain lipids to fatty acids; trypsin and chymotrypsin mixed with brain in control experiments failed to form acid. When incubated with segments of the spinal cord of experimental animals, the lipolytic enzyme brought about a loss of stainable myelin in peripheral areas and in the spinal nerve roots; again trypsin and chymotrypsin had no such effect in control experiments. The findings as a whole show that an enzyme preparation with lipolytic activity has the ability to destroy myelin in living animals, and in vitro as well, and to produce lesions remarkably similar to those of multiple sclerosis.

Both viruses multiplied in the rabbit eye as an inapparent infection. Little or no virus could be recovered from the optic nerves or brains of the rabbits, although virus was present in high titer in the eyes.

The carcinogen induces a pronounced metaplasia of the epithelium of the bronchial tree, and the altered cells are often aggressive, multiplying, invading, and largely replacing the parenchyma about them. So closely do they resemble malignant elements in aspect and behavior that it is frequently difficult to tell whether carcinomatous change is not actually present. Genuine tumors soon arise, multiple benign adenomas sometimes appearing within 3 weeks, and indubitable carcinomas a few weeks later. Not a few of the cancers are of transitional cell type, that is to say are expressive of an intermediate stage in the metaplasia. Under the influence of methylcholanthrene the cells lining the alveolar spaces of the graft sometimes undergo metaplasia also, with result in stratified squamous epithelium. It follows that there is reason to doubt the current assumption that all squamous cell carcinomas of the lung necessarily arise from the bronchial tree.

In these cases, the heart was completely free of lesions. No histologic tissue reactions typical of tuberculosis were seen in the animals dying from the acute type of the disease. A similar rapidly progressing infection was observed in rabbits infected with bacteria from young cultures. The symptoms corresponded to the ones seen in the disease known as the Yersin type of tuberculosis. It seems that the pathology of this latter can be produced with every type of pathogenic mycobacteria, human as well as bovine and avian, provided the cultures used are young. Thus it may be inferred that the acute type of tuberculosis is more frequent than commonly accepted both in experimental infection and in the naturally occurring disease. It is proposed to explain the mechanism of this acute infection within the framework of the cord factor hypothesis.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Mycobacterium tuberculosis"],"pmid":"14784534","title":"Studies on the virulence of tubercle bacilli; the relationship of the physiological state of the organisms to their pathogenicity.","year":"1950"},

{"abstractText":"Excretion of poliomyelitis virus has been demonstrated in monkeys after four different parenteral routes of inoculation. Virus has been found in both the pharyngeal secretions and the stools after infraorbital nerve dip and after inoculation of the Gasserian ganglion; in the pharyngeal secretions after intrathalamic inoculation; and in the stools after inoculation of the celiac ganglion. Excretion began as early as the 2nd and as late as the 7th day after inoculation, in all instances before the onset of symptoms. The immediate source of the excreted virus appeared to be infected peripheral ganglia with neural connections to the mucous membranes of the upper and lower portions of the alimentary tract, notably the pharynx. Primary infection of the body surfaces was excluded in the experiments and therefore could not account for the excretion of virus. The mode of elimination was probably by centrifugal spread through axons of peripheral nerve fibers and not by way of the blood stream or lymphatics. Evidence was obtained that when excretion of virus has once occurred, reinvasion from the implicated surface to other, previously uninfected peripheral ganglia ensues, thus providing new sources for excretion and other potential pathways for invasion of the CNS. It is suggested that such reinvasion may occur serially until the immunological defenses come into play. Our experiments lend support to the view that during the initial stage of poliomyelitis, and perhaps throughout its course in some cases, e.g. the asymptomatic and the mild cases without central nervous symptoms, infection is confined to the peripheral nervous system. Involvement of the CNS when it occurs is a secondary phase of the infective process and is not a necessary prelude to elimination of the virus. Excretion is explainable on the basis of the established neurocytotropism and axonal conduction of the virus without resort to the hypothesis of extraneural infection.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Poliomyelitis"],"pmid":"14784538","title":"Studies on entry and egress of poliomyelitis infection.

Then the system is allowed to discharge into a needle cannula inserted in the tissue. The manometer forces out fluid (about 10 c.mm.) until the pressure within it is the same as that within the tissue. Records of the pressure changes are made. Each observation takes about a minute. The method gives results that are closely comparable with other reports of tissue pressures. With this method, the pressure in the following organs of dogs was found to be: kidney, 26 mm. Hg, cerebral cortex, 0 to 5 mm., muscle, 1 to 10 mm., spleen, S to 16 mm., subcutaneous tissue, 0 to 3 mm., and liver -2 to 14 mm. The reliability of the method was tested on the kidneys of decerebrate dogs. Measurements were found to be the same within narrow limits over a period of an hour; they were the same when taken simultaneously in different regions of the same kidney or in opposite kidneys. They were independent of the volume of fluid forced into the tissue. Similar pressures were observed with 1 or 5 or 10 holes bored in the shaft of the cannulating needle.

These pressure-volume factors influence the rate of spreading and determine the final area of spreading. When a constant volume is injected, the rate of spreading to the area determined by the volume of injection is a function of the enzyme concentration. These and other findings have led to the conclusion that hyaluronidase is an effective spreading agent only when the slow diffusion of enzyme in skin is accelerated by a localized increase of interstitial pressure and volume. These considerations of hyaluronidase action in skin have been utilized to explain the shape of the dosage-response curve of hyaluronidase spreading activity, and the differences in the spreading reactions between crude snake venoms and purified hyaluronidase.

Different strains of mice differ markedly in their susceptibility to experimental tuberculous infection; the highest susceptibility was observed among the pigmented strains (line 1 dba and C57 black).

Lesions thought to be characteristic of poliomyelitis in inoculated chimpanzees could not be sharply differentiated from lesions of unknown origin in uninoculated control animals. Moreover, although the inoculated animals as a group, in comparison with the control animals, had a greater number of infiltrative lesions in sympathetic as well as in sensory ganglia, it was not possible to make satisfactory correlations between the distribution of these lesions and the routes of inoculation. 3. In sharp contrast with chimpanzees, the celiac and stellate ganglia of the human poliomyelitis cases were free of any but insignificant infiltrative lesions. Lesions in human trigeminal and spinal sensory ganglia included neuronal damage as well as focal and perivascular inflitrative lesions, as is well known. In most ganglia, as in monkey and chimpanzee sensory ganglia, these were correlated in intensify with the degree of severity of lesions in the region of the CNS receiving their axons. This suggested that lesions in sensory ganglia probably resulted from spread of virus centrifugally from the CNS, in accord with considerable experimental evidence. 4. Two principal difficulties in the interpretation of histopathological findings in peripheral ganglia were revealed by this study. The first is that the specificity of lesions in sympathetic ganglia has not been established beyond doubt as being due to poliomyelitis.

It has been used to investigate the properties of such waves produced by the impact of a high velocity missile on the surface of water. The method can be adapted for study of behavior of shock waves in tissue by placing the tissue on a water surface or immersing it in water. Spark shadowgrams then reveal waves passing from tissue to water or reflected from tissue surfaces. Reflection and transmission of shock waves from muscle, liver, stomach, and intestinal wall are compared with reflection from non-living surfaces such as gelatin gel, steel, plexiglas, cork, and air. Because of its heterogeneous structure, waves transmitted by tissue are dispersed and appear as a series of wavelets. When the accoustical impedance (density x wave velocity) of a medium is less than that in which the wave is moving, reflection will occur with inversion of the wave; i.e., a high pressure wave will become a low pressure wave. This inversion occurs at an air surface and is illustrated by shadowgrams of reflection from stomach wall, from a segment of colon filled with gas, and from air-filled rubber balloons. Bone (human skull and beef ribs) shows good reflection and some transmission of shock waves.

In liver cells about portal spaces, in foci of regeneration, and in tumor cells the rims of the cytochondria stain with basic dyes and contain ribonucleic acid or related substances. With increasing accumulation of basophile substances about cytochondria as the central veins are approached, these bodies aggregate to form clumps or orient themselves with palisade-like arrangment in two rows just within the margins of the liver cell columns. With aggregation of the cytochondria that are surrounded by basophile material, other cytochondria in the same cells are devoid of this material and wholly acidophile. With chromatolysis (disappearance of basophile substance) caused by dimethylaminoazobeiizene (butter yellow) cytochondria lose their peripheral basophilia and stain only with acid dyes. When ribonucleic acid is removed from fixed liver tissue by ribonuclease, cytochondria lose their affinity for basic stains and become acidophile. Of the cytochondria that are surrounded by ribonucleic acid or related substances part have the characteristics of mitochondria. Under the influence of butter yellow cytochondria may become greatly swollen and intensely acidophile in the center though they retain their basophile rim. These swollen bodies in part at least have the reactions of mitochondria. In tumor cells of hepatomas mitochondria are smaller and less abundant than in parenchymatous cells of the liver, and accompanying them are bodies of similar size which do not react as mitochondria.

{"abstractText":"1. A relatively small amount of penicillin sufficed to abort syphilitic infection in rabbits when administered during the incubation period of the disease. 2. The abortive dose, given as a single intramuscular injection in oil and beeswax, varied with the age of the infection. (a) With a fixed intratesticular inoculum, the amount of penicillin necessary to prevent infection in half the animals remained at a constant level for 4 days. By the end of the 2nd week more than seven times this dosage was needed; and by the 6th week, after the chancre had appeared, more than thirty times the amount was needed to obtain the same result. The progressive increase in the abortive dose of penicillin with the passage of time probably reflects the interim multiplication of organisms. (b) Qualitatively similar results were obtained in rabbits inoculated intracutaneously. 3. The abortive dose varied also with the size of the inoculum. In animals inoculated intracutaneously with 20, 2,000, and 200,000 spirochetes, and treated 4 days later, it required 200, 500, and 3,500 units per kg., respectively, to protect half the animals, and the corresponding PD(90) dosages were 500, 2,000, and 16,000 units per kg. 4. The present observations, indicating the ease of aborting experimental rabbit syphilis during the incubation period by a single injection of penicillin, are perhaps applicable to the prevention of the disease in man. 5. Asymptomatic infections were rare in animals receiving inadequate doses of penicillin during the incubation period. Sixty-four of sixty-five such animals developed darkfield-positive lesions at the inoculated site. In animals treated 6 weeks after inoculation, however, after the development of lesions, inadequate treatment was usually manifested by an asymptomatic redissemination of organisms demonstrable only by lymph node transfer. The difference in the two groups probably reflects the beginning development of immunity in the rabbits treated 6 weeks after inoculation. 6.

{"abstractText":"Methylene blue (MB) and toluidine blue (TB) when administered in maximum tolerated oral doses to mice and to cotton rats are highly effective in preventing the usual lethal outcome of intraperitoneally induced infections with R. orientalis. This activity is manifest even when dye administration is delayed until a systemic infection has been well established. Methylene blue is also effective in cerebral infections in mice. The toxicity of MB, however, limits parenteral (subcutaneous) administration of the dye to dosage levels which are much less effective than the maximum tolerated oral levels. The inability of mice to tolerate an adequately effective parenteral dose of MB suggests that the properties of the dye responsible for its toxicity may be separated from those upon which its antirickettsial effect depends. The relationship between the response of mice to oral treatment with MB and such factors as the size of the infecting dose and the times of initiation and of withdrawal of treatment may be summarized as follows: 1. With a constant infecting dose, the time of initiation of treatment largely determines the degree of therapeutic effect. 2. The interval after infection beyond which further treatment does not increase the survival rate depends not upon the previous duration of treatment but upon the size of the infecting dose. Paradoxically, treatment can be discontinued sooner after a massive infecting dose than after a smaller one.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Coloring Agents","Methylene Blue","Rickettsia Infections","Scrub Typhus","Tolonium Chloride"],"pmid":"19871635","title":"THE ANTIRICKETTSIAL EFFECT OF THIONINE DYES : I.

{"abstractText":"1. Beginning at 24 hours after intravenous injection of about 10 million intracerebral LD(50) of virus there was evidence of simultaneous, progressive multiplication in the brain and intestinal tract. 2. When the virus was introduced directly into the brain or the nasal cavities and mouth, none was found in the intestinal tract until there was general centrifugal spread from the central nervous system during the last stages of the infection at 96 or 120 hours after inoculation when the virus in the entire brain had reached a concentration of about 3 billion LD(50). 3. Centrifugal spread began when the virus in the brain reached a concentration of about 400 million LD(50) and virus appeared in the pharynx, tongue, and adrenals before it was demonstrable in the intestinal tract, blood, or viscera such as the spleen, liver, and kidneys. 4. Despite the high concentrations of virus which developed in the intestinal tract following intravenous inoculation, it was not demonstrable in the stools, differing in this respect from Theiler's virus in mice and poliomyelitis virus in human beings and monkeys. 5. No antiviral agent was found in the stools, but the urine of normal mice having a pH of 5.6, inactivated large amounts of St. Louis encephalitis virus. 6. There was no evidence of multiplication in the nasal mucosa of mice which succumbed with encephalitis following nasal instillation of the virus, the course of events being comparable in this respect to the behavior of the M.V. poliomyelitis virus in rhesus monkeys. 7. At the terminal stage of infection the virus content per milligram of tissue was as great in the leg muscles as in the sciatic nerves. Since this was also true for the urinary bladder, heart, lungs, and tongue among other tissues, and since the amount in the blood was too negligible to account for it, it would appear that the virus either accumulated in these tissues by diffusion from the nerve fibers, along which it was spreading from the central nervous system, or that it multiplied in some constituent other than the nerve fibers.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Encephalitis Viruses"],"pmid":"19871641","title":"MULTIPLICATION AND SPREAD OF THE VIRUS OF ST.

{"abstractText":"Biotin deficiency produced by a synthetic biotin-deficient diet was as effective in decreasing the resistance of chickens to infection with Plasmodium lophurae as biotin deficiency produced by a diet high in egg white. In moderately biotin-deficient ducks Plasmodium cathemerium at first multiplied more slowly than in adequately fed controls. The parasitemia in the deficient animals later overtook that in the controls and attained higher peak parasite numbers. The multiplication of P. cathemerium was notably inhibited in ducks inoculated when they were approaching death from biotin deficiency. The total and differential leucocyte count of biotin-deficient chickens did not differ significantly from that of adequately fed controls. During infection of chickens with P. lophurae and ducks with either P. lophurae or P. cathemerium significant changes occur in the concentration in the plasma of free biotin and of a material which on hydrolysis yields a fat-soluble substance (FSF) having the biological activities of biotin but differing chemically from it. In ducks which survived infections with P. cathemerium or P. lophurae the biotin concentration rose very early in the course of the infection, before there was any anemia. It fell slightly, rose to a peak at about the time of the peak parasite number, and then returned to normal. The concentration of bound FSF, which was determined in terms of its biotin activity, increased at first, then decreased, then rose and continued at a high level throughout the period of decline in parasitemia. In most of the animals which died of either infection the free biotin, instead of returning to normal, rose to very high values Just before death, while the bound FSF, instead of remaining at a high value, fell to very low values, reaching zero in several animals. Greater resistance seemed to be associated with a greater excess of bound FSF over free biotin. In animals about to die the free biotin exceeded the bound FSF. The biotin content of the liver of ducks and chickens fed an adequate diet and killed just after having undergone an infection with either P. lophurae or P. cathemerium was much less than that of control uninfected animals. When P. lophurae was cultured in vitro in suspensions of duck erythrocytes a very wide range in biotin concentration in the culture fluid did not affect its rate of multiplication. Plasma protein fractions relatively rich in FSF at a concentration of 0.75 per cent inhibited multiplication, while comparable concentrations of plasma fractions poor in FSF did not. The results obtained fit the assumption that the substance in plasma which yields FSF is directly concerned in resistance to avian malaria.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Malaria, Avian","Vitamin B Complex"],"pmid":"19871642","title":"THE RELATION TO THE COURSE OF AVIAN MALARIA OF BIOTIN AND A FAT-SOLUBLE MATERIAL HAVING THE BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES OF BIOTIN.","year":"1947"},
{"abstractText":"Theoretical analysis of the mechanism of action of chemical aerial disinfectants reveals that the rapid killing action which is obtained cannot be accounted for by a collision process between germicidal aerosol particles and the air-borne bacteria. However, a mechanism involving condensation of germicide molecules in the vapor state on to the bacteria-containing droplets results in a theoretical velocity of the correct order of magnitude. Experimental tests of this theory show that pure germicide vapors free of aerosol droplets are almost instantly lethal to air-borne bacteria. Conversely, pure germicidal aerosols in the absence of vapor, had no effect on air-borne bacteria within 20 minutes or more. Therefore, it may be concluded on both theoretical and experimental grounds that rapid air sterilization requires the existence of the germicide in the vapor state.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Air Microbiology","Disinfection","Glycols"],"pmid":"19871646","title":"THE MECHANISM OF AERIAL DISINFECTION BY GLYCOLS AND OTHER CHEMICAL AGENTS : I.

{"abstractText":"The effectiveness of any compound as an aerial germicide depends upon the extent of condensation of its vapor on air-suspended bacteria, and on the rate at which the resulting concentration of germicide can produce death of the microorganisms. The properties of any compound conducive to production of the highest rate of kill of air-borne microorganisms by means of the smallest possible concentration of germicide vapor, are as folows: (a) a low vapor pressure, but not lower than 0.001 mm. Hg at 25 degrees C.; (b) high hygroscopicity; (c) toxicity for bacterial metabolism-a high degree of potency is not necessary although the killing action will be more efficient the higher the antibacterial activity of the compound employed. For any compound the killing action is always a direct function of the concentration of its vapor in the air. The maximum amount of a hygroscopic substance which can exist in the vapor state decreases as the relative humidity increases. Hence, at high relative humidities the bactericidal efficiency is lowest. At lower relative humidities the air can contain more vapor, and hence a greater effect is possible. At any relative humidity, the killing action is greater, the more closely the germicide vapor concentration approaches the saturation point. The presence of soluble compounds in droplets containing bacteria promotes more extensive condensation of the germicide than would otherwise occur, and so enhances its effectiveness. In the absence of such soluble substances, low atmospheric humidities may cause complete desiccation of a bacterial particle. Under these conditions its surface may become resistant to the condensation of the vapor, and thus prevent effective germicidal action. The influence of temperature changes on the killing efficiency maybe correctly deduced from a consideration of the effect of a rise in temperature on the vapor pressure of the germicide and on the rate of its bactericidal action in vitro. Equations are presented for estimating quantitatively the magnitude of some of the effects discussed.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Air Microbiology","Disinfection","Glycols"],"pmid":"19871647","title":"THE MECHANISM OF AERIAL DISINFECTION BY GLYCOLS AND OTHER CHEMICAL AGENTS : II.

The inhibitory effect of the commercial product Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate) on the growth of small inocula of tubercle bacilli in liquid media is caused by its content of unesterified oleic acid (0.6 per cent by weight). Purified Tween 80, freed of this contaminating fatty acid, not only permits growth of small inocula, but protects against small amounts of added oleic acid.

All efforts to increase the yield of virus have failed.

{"abstractText":"Experiments have been reported on the propagation of influenza viruses in the allantoic membrane of the developing chick embryo during the first infectious cycle. After adsorption of the seed virus onto the host cells, only a small percentage of it remains demonstrable by infectivity titrations. This amount remains constant for 4 hours in the case of infection with PR8 virus, and for 6 hours in that of infection with Lee virus. Thereafter, a sharp rise in infectivity occurs 2 to 3 hours before liberation of the new generations of active virus into the allantoic fluid can be detected. Injection of homologous virus, inactivated by ultraviolet irradiation, following infection prevents or delays the production of virus in the tissues, depending to some extent upon the number of ID(50) of active virus used as inoculum. The smaller the dose, the more pronounced the inhibitory effect. With increasing delay in the injection of the inhibitor, progressively more virus is produced and liberated 6 and 9 hours after infection with PR8 and Lee virus, respectively. Thus, production of virus may be interrupted by the homologous inhibitor when given up to 3 hours after infection with PR8, and up to4(1\/2) hours after infection with Lee virus. Since no increase in infectivity can bedetected during these 3 and 4(1\/2) hour periods in the tissues, it is suggested that influenza virus propagates in at least two major stages: first, non-infectious, immature virus material is produced which, subsequently, is converted into the fully active agent. Presumably the first step can be interrupted by the homologous inhibitor, while the second cannot. Heterologous irradiated virus, injected after infection of the tissue, exerts only a slight inhibitory effect on the production of virus.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"18152336","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system; the propagation of virus in conjunction with the host cells.","year":"1949"},

In contrast, the titers of hemagglutinin and complement-fixing antigen (virus antigen) have already begun to rise after 3 hours. The origin of the hemagglutinating and complement-fixing but non-infectious material is still obscure. In the allantoic membrane development of both the soluble and virus antigens can be demonstrated after the 2nd hour of incubation and 1 hour prior to an increase in hemagglutinins and 2 hours prior to a rise in infectivity. Thus there remain the first 2 hours during which no record of virus activity in the tissues can be obtained. Similar relationships are noted on dilution of the seed both in the allantoic fluids and membranes as long as the various properties reach measurable levels during the experimental period of one infectious cycle. Injection of high titered immune serum following infection with about 10(9) ID(50) reduces the amount of demonstrable seed virus in the allantoic fluid and membrane without significantly affecting propagation of the agent in the tissues as measured by infectivity titrations.

Administration of lipotropic factors (casein, methionine, choline) was followed not only by reduction of fat infiltration and by regeneration of hepatic parenchyma but, by a reduction of the degree of the fibrosis. In one group of rats, comparison of sections obtained by biopsy, before treatment, with findings at necropsy, after completed therapy, indicated apparent reduction of the fibrosis and of the amount of ceroid and considerable restoration of architecture. This improvement, however, was obtained neither with complete regularity nor in a short time.

It is assumed that factors determining prevention are beneficial only to a limited extent in treatment. The therapy of very severe cirrhosis may require the interaction of further beneficial factors (nutritional and hormonal). Best therapeutic results were obtained by the combination of an adequate amount of casein with methionine or liver extract, and by the combination of methionine with liver extract. Methionine and thiouracil, both of which, singly, are effective in the prevention of dietary hepatic cirrhosis in rats, have proved to be less effective for the therapy of cirrhosis, when administered together, than methionine given alone for the same purpose.

{"abstractText":"Five strains of type III pneumococcus have been shown to possess wide capsular slime layers during the logarithmic phase of growth in serum broth. The slime layer stains metachromatically with methylene blue and can be visualized under the electron microscope as a fuzzy halo which extends well beyond the surace of the capsule proper and causes centrifugates of the organism to be of extremely large volume. This outer capsular structure is most readily demonstrated in vivo and in nutrient broth containing glucose and serum. It disappears from the surface of the cell with aging of the culture, and is easily removed by dilute alkali, alcohol, and heat. Exposure of slime-covered type III pneumococci to homologous antibody and to type III polysaccharidase reveals that the slime layer contains the same type-specific polysaccharide that is present in the rest of the capsule. From a type III strain producing a prominent slime layer an intermediate mutant has been isolated which forms small non-mucoid colonies on blood agar and possesses a relatively small capsule with a barely discernible slime layer. The wide slime layer protects virulent type III pneumococci from surface phagocytosis. Whenever the type III cells lose their broad slime layer, whether from aging of the culture, from mutation, from exposure to injurious chemicals, or from the action of type III polysaccharidase, they become susceptible to phagocytosis by the surface mechanism. Once phagocyted the type III pneumococci are promptly destroyed, even in the absence of antibodies.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Phagocytes","Phagocytosis","Streptococcus pneumoniae"],"pmid":"18152341","title":"The inhibition of surface phagocytosis by the capsular slime layer of pneumococcus type III.","year":"1949"},

{"abstractText":"It has proved possible to transform an extreme rough variant of pneumococcus back to the rough state by the action of the desoxyribonucleate fractions of either rough or Type III smooth pneumococci. In a second step, the rough pneumococci produced by this transformation were further changed to the Type III smooth state by means of the desoxyribonucleate fraction of Type III smooth organisms. With use of the Type III desoxyribonucleate, the two steps could be accomplished successively, but not simultaneously, during the growth of a single inoculum of the extreme rough form. These findings have been interpreted as indicating that the desoxyribonucleic acid fraction of Type III smooth pneumococci contains two transforming principles of differing specificity, while the same fraction of rough pneumococci contains but one of these principles. Two distinct spontaneous variants of Type III smooth pneumococci have been isolated which seem to differ from normal Type III smooth pneumococci in synthesizing smaller amounts of the specific polysaccharide. Tests have indicated that these variant Type III races differ from the normal in possessing altered Type III transforming principles. Each of the new transforming agents when influencing rough bacteria, is strictly specific in its action, inducing as it does the formation of the corresponding variant Type III pneumococci. Interaction between the two new transforming principles and rough pneumococci can lead to the production of normal Type III organisms, although neither principle alone can do it. This is interpreted as indicating that the two mutated Type III transforming principles are qualitatively different from each other. Another kind of two-step transformation was accomplished by converting rough pneumococci first into the variant Type III pneumococci which produced very little specific polysaccharide, and then by transforming these latter into normal Type III organisms. After the two-step transformation of the extreme rough pneumococcus, both transforming principles used to effect this can be recognized in the Type III smooth pneumococci finally recovered.

{"abstractText":"Radioactive iron was administered to three normal dogs, two of which had previously been bled, in order to tag a group of erythrocytes of approximately known age. The osmotic fragility of the newly formed tagged cells was significantly greater than that of the general cell population during the first few days after injection of the iron, while the mechanical fragility of the young cells was less than that of the general red cell population. As the cells aged and approached the end of their life span, their susceptibility to destruction by trauma inflicted by rolling glass beads exceeded that of the general cell population. The osmotic behavior of the old cells was not distinctive. The increased mechanical fragility of senescent cells suggests that the life span of erythrocytes may be limited at least in part by changes within the cell which render it more susceptible to destruction by mechanical wear and tear in the circulation. It is emphasized, however, that the trauma produced by rolling glass beads may be quite unlike that inflicted upon red cells in vivo. A decrease in circulating radioactive iron was observed in each experiment soon after the mechanical fragility of the tagged cells began to exceed that of the total cell population. The lowest point on the curve representing circulating radioiron was noted at 119, 119, and 122 days respectively after injection of iron in the three experiments. Estimates of the life span of dog erythrocytes obtained in this way agree with those provided by other methods.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Age Factors","Erythrocytes"],"pmid":"15404222","title":"Age as effecting the osmotic and mechanical fragility of dog erythrocytes tagged with radioactive iron.","year":"1950"},

Five virus strains were tested for their capacity to inactivate the virus hemagglutinin of human plasma and of egg white. In the case of egg white all strains including mumps and Newcastle disease virus inactivated the inhibitor completely, or nearly so. With plasma the influenza strains inactivated the inhibitor completely but mumps and NDV destroyed only that portion of the complex which effected mumps inhibition. The inhibitor for some strains was destroyed more rapidly than that for others and the sequence in which they were destroyed (inhibitor gradient) was similar, regardless of the strain employed.

{"abstractText":"The bacillary cords characteristic for virulent tubercle bacilli are readily disrupted when wet bacilli are suspended in hydrocarbons such as paraffin oil or petroleum ether. The disruption of cords is due to the removal of a material coating the surface of the bacilli and causing them to adhere to each other. This material can be obtained from virulent bacilli by extracting them with petroleum ether. It is a lipid. Avirulent variants of tubercle bacilli do not yield a similar material after extraction in the same manner; only little of it is obtained from BCG bacilli. The following properties of the fraction obtained by petroleum ether extraction are described: (a) It inhibits the migration of leukocytes in vitro. (b) If repeatedly injected in small doses into mice, it is toxic, whereas a single high dose does not give rise to toxic manifestations. (c) The susceptibility of mice to the toxic action of repeated injections parallels to some extent their degree of susceptibility to infection with the strain of tubercle bacilli from which the fraction was obtained. (d) The injection of the extracted material into guinea pigs does not induce a state of allergic reactivity toward tuberculin. Likewise, tuberculin-positive guinea pigs do not show hypersensitivity against injections of the extracted substance. Bacilli extracted with petroleum ether do not lose their viability. They grow out normally in vitro, and they are still pathogenic. However, the removal of the petroleum ether-soluble lipid from the bacilli results in a loss of the ability of the organisms to inhibit the migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Moreover, mice and guinea pigs infected with extracted bacilli may develop tuberculosis considerably slower than animals injected with comparable amounts of unextracted organisms. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the problem of the virulence of tubercle bacilli.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Mycobacterium tuberculosis"],"pmid":"15404225","title":"Studies on the virulence of tubercle bacilli; isolation and biological properties of a constituent of virulent organisms.","year":"1950"},

{"abstractText":"The role of inhibitors of hemagglutination in the evaluation of host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system has been analyzed. Comparisons were made between materials (allantoic fluids and membrane suspensions) derived from in vivo (growth curve) experiments at hourly intervals after inoculation, and from in vitro tests in which normal allantoic fluids and membrane suspensions were incubated with virus at 37 degrees C. for various periods of time. In both instances large amounts of virus were added to the systems, resulting in comparable concentrations of the agent. The seeds employed were either fully active or irradiated by ultraviolet light to the extent that the virus lost its capacity to increase but kept its interfering and hemagglutinating properties. The various materials were assayed for (a) the hemagglutinating titers of the virus present in the systems before and after heating to 56 degrees C.; (b) the concentration of inhibitor in the materials at various stages of incubation after heating to 70 degrees C. for 30 minutes as measured by the hemagglutination-inhibition reaction with native or heated test virus (30 minutes 56 degrees C.); and (c) the degree of adsorption of the hemagglutinins present in the materials onto chicken red cells at 0 degrees C. and their subsequent elution at 37 degrees C. The effects of receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE), treatment with sodium periodate, or high speed centrifugation on the inhibitory activities were studied in some of the tests. The essential results which indicate certain sources of error in the evaluation of host-virus interactions as well as means for studying virus activity at the early stages of the infectious process, were as follows: 1. Though some inhibitory effects on hemagglutination were noticeable in the allantoic fluid during the 1st hour after inoculation they were, as a rule, no longer apparent after this interval, and treatment with RDE did not increase the hemagglutinin titers. Thus, the interpretation of growth curve data concerning allantoic fluids hardly seems to be affected by inhibitor. On the other hand, striking effects were noted with the membrane suspensions of growth curve experiments in that RDE shortened the latent period to 2 hours and the titers in the first few positive samples (4 to 5 hours) increased) whereas in later harvests no such effect was noted. Under these conditions complement-fixation antigens and hemagglutinins made their appearance in the tissues simultaneously and not as previously reported the former prior to the latter. However, the infectivity showed increments only several hours after these two activities had become measurable. Thus the hypothesis of the stagewise development of influenza virus is still supported by these data. 2. Using the inhibition of hemagglutination technic it was found that the inhibitor in allantoic fluid rapidly decreased as a result of the action of active and irradiated virus, but destruction was never complete. In the membranes of the in vivo series only active seed led to loss of inhibitor, again without complete destruction, beginning at the time complement-fixing antigen and hemagglutinins became measurable. Irradiated seed was without effect in vivo whereas, in the in vitro tests it equalled the activity of the active virus. The implications of this difference in the effectiveness of active and irradiated seed in vivo with regard to the understanding of the mode of viral multiplication are discussed. 3. Although many factors may influence the shape of adsorption-elution curves it is felt that at 0 degrees C. the extent of adsorption is directly related to the amount of inhibitor present in the systems. In the early hours after inoculation the degree of adsorption was relatively small but it increased gradually with the time of incubation. The inhibitor of adsorption was destroyed by RDE and NaIO(4) and was only partially sedimentable by high speed centrifugation. In every respect studied its properties corresponded with the findings obtained with inhibitors in the hemagglutination-inhibition technic. Although the difference in the rapidity of inhibitor destruction as measured by the various technics might suggest a multiplicity of inhibitors it is felt that it rather denotes a greater sensitivity of the adsorption technic as compared to the others.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"14888812","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system.

{"abstractText":"The combined passage of influenza A and B viruses in series, as reported by Sugg and Magill, has been confirmed. When the mixed passage materials were not too highly diluted both agents could be traced through 10 transfers. Growth curve experiments revealed that both agents developed independently, as measured by hemagglutination-inhibition tests in the presence of specific immune sera against one or the other type. However, the hemagglutinin titers of the 2 viruses in the mixed series were always substantially lower than those recorded when the strains were used individually as seed in the same concentrations as were employed in the mixed series. Assay of the infectivity titers of the individual strains in the presence of appropriate immune sera led to the demonstration that the time required for the growth cycle of influenza B virus varied with the dose of seed virus. With undiluted infected allantoic fluid as seed only 4 to 5 hours elapsed before new generations of virus were liberated. With increasing 10-fold dilution of the seed the constant period became increasingly longer until it stabilized at 8 to 10 hours. This finding offers an explanation for the seeming discrepancy between the observations on interference between the 2 viruses and the difference reported previously in the extent of their growth periods, on the one hand, and the fact that the 2 agents could be carried simultaneously in series through numerous passages in the chick embryo.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"14888813","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system.

{"abstractText":"Methods have been devised whereby the persistence of foreign antigens in mice can be detected. A highly diffusible, blue azo dye, echt-säure-blau was coupled to bovine gamma-globulin and human serum albumin and injected into the animals. In this way deep blue tracer antigens were obtained. These were promptly stored in cells widely distributed throughout the body, especially in the reticulo-endothelial elements of the liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes. The dye as such was not stored but rapidly excreted. A blue coloration in the organs just mentioned was still perceptible after 85 to 120 days in the case of the azoglobulin and 36 to 44 days in that of the azoalbumin. To determine whether these substances had actually persisted, as well as to learn how long uncoupled globulin and albumin remained after injection, recourse was had to the phenomenon of reversed passive anaphylaxis, which was found to be characterized by extraordinary changes in the vessels of the ears (EVR) in the mouse, plainly visible under the microscope when called forth by an antiserum specific for the antigen to which the animal had been sensitized. So sensitive is the vascular response that as little as 0.5 to 0.1 microg. of protein as antigen, previously injected into the peritoneal cavity of a 30 gm. mouse, can be detected a few days later by an intravenous injection of antiserum. By means of the EVR the globulin antigen has been detected in the blood and livers of injected mice for as long as 56 and 101 days, respectively; the albumin and azoalbumin for only 21 and 36 days. In the mesenteric lymph nodes of injected mice the albumin and azoalbumin antigens were found after 42 and 44 days, respectively. The hepatic tissue and that of the mesenteric lymph nodes of mice injected with azoalbumin, containing in consequence stored blue material, when transferred to recipient mice yielded positive tests for antigen (EVR) as long as blue color could be perceived in these tissues with the unaided eye, or at low magnification. After the color had disappeared from the tissues the transfer tests were found to be negative. This fact speaks for the antigenicity of the colored material. In summary it is plain that certain antigenic proteins, after introduction into the blood stream of mice, are stored in certain tissues and that they may persist there for weeks or even months, far longer than has generally been supposed. This persistence of antigen within the body, especially after detectable amounts of antigen have apparently disappeared from the blood, provides a reason for prolonged antibody formation, a phenomenon for which no adequate explanation has hereto been offered.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Antibodies","Antigens","Proteins"],"pmid":"14888815","title":"The persistence in mice of certain foreign proteins and azoprotein tracer-antigens derived from them.","year":"1951"},

Titration of infectivity in embryos proved to be a more sensitive procedure than titration in mice; the latter procedure however, had the advantage of greater simplicity and gave more clear-cut results. The mouse titration method was used in most of the experiments. Following inoculation of virus into the allantois, there was a slow decrease in infectivity in the allantoic fluids followed by an increase due to appearance of new virus between 24 and 48 hours. The slope of declining infectivity in the allantoic fluids in ovo was similar if not identical with the slope of decreasing infectivity in allantoic fluids in vitro caused by thermal degradation of virus. Multiplication of the virus in allantoic membranes was characterized by the following pattern: (a) Increase in infectivity in the first few hours (exact duration of increase depended on concentration of virus in inoculum) due to adsorption of virus.

By a method of hepatic venous catheterization previously described, comparative data have been obtained concerning the removal of pneumococci from the splanchnic circulating blood of the intact rabbit in bacteriemias secondary to a dermal infection and in bacteriemias induced by a continuous infusion of organisms into the blood stream. The average splanchnic removal in secondary pneumococcal bacteriemias was 8 +\/- 14 per cent (S.D.), in induced bacteriemias 9 +\/- 15 per cent (S.D.). 2. Similar data were obtained in induced M. aureus bacteriemias in normal rabbits and in induced M. aureus bacteriemias superimposed upon pneumococcal bacteriemias secondary to dermal infection. The average splanchnic removal of M. aureus in normal rabbits was 62 +\/- 20 per cent (S.D.). The splanchnic removal of M. aureus in rabbits with a simultaneous pneumococcal bacteriemia of infection was of the same order of magnitude as in normal rabbits. 3. The efficiency of the mechanism of splanchnic removal for a given organism is an important factor in the establishment and maintenance of a bacteriemia. Present evidence indicates that the maintenance of a bacteriemia requires a constant introduction into the blood stream of organisms from some source. 4.

{"abstractText":"Blood pressures were determined on forty-two young male albino rats and a basal level established. The rats were then divided into four groups and subjected to one of the following operations: (a) unilateral nephrectomy with exposure and handling of the opposite kidney; (b) unilateral nephrectomy and constriction of the remaining kidney with a silk figure-of-eight ligature; (c) unilateral renal constriction with a silk figure-of-eight ligature, the other kidney being left intact after exposure and handling; (d) unilateral nephrectomy and removal of the poles of the contralateral kidney (three-quarters nephrectomy). The animals were followed for 50 days, during which blood pressures were measured on twenty occasions, then killed by exsanguination under ether anesthesia. The organs were weighed according to a standardized procedure and studied histologically. Individual determinations of serum creatinine and of the hematocrit levels were made. Mean lines and frequency distributions of blood pressure were subjected to statistical analysis. A definitely significant increase in blood pressure developed in the group subjected to operation (b) within 4 days postoperative. In none of the other groups did hypertension develop. Analysis of the individual renal weights and creatinine levels indicates the independence of the development of hypertension from the total mass of functioning renal tissue. Nor is it dependent on the prevention of renal hypertrophy or the presence of fibrous perinephritis. The effect is probably due to the production of a disturbance of hemodynamics or tissue tension with the liberation of a pressor substance by the injured kidney.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Hypertension"],"pmid":"15422098","title":"The pathogenesis of hypertension induced by renal constriction.","year":"1950"},

Gum acacia injections had been discontinued previous to the start of the experiments, and hence it must be concluded that the excess amounts of acacia were derived from deposits in the various organs. These observations verify the previous suggestion that the increase in blood acacia in the hypoproteinemic dog on a low protein diet is due to the transfer of acacia to the blood from its sites of deposit in the body.

{"abstractText":"Experimental pneumonia was produced with a highly virulent strain of type III pneumococcus which synthesizes, during rapid growth, large amounts of capsular polysaccharide. The type III pneumonia differed from that caused by pneumococcus I in that (a) death occurred more promptly in the type III infection, (b) the local pulmonary lesion became more heavily infected, and (c) frank suppuration was common even after otherwise effective chemotherapy. The greater pathogenicity of the type III organism was shown by special histologic techniques to be due primarily to its capsular slime layer which interferes with surface phagocytosis. Capsular polysaccharide shed from the organism during growth was also demonstrated in high concentration in certain parts of the pneumonic lesion. Removal of the excess polysaccharide from the alveoli resulted from (a) lymphatic drainage to regional lymph nodes and (b) phagocytosis, particularly by macrophages. The possible relationship of the free carbohydrate to the malignancy and the characteristically viscous exudate of type III pneumonia was discussed. The lung abscesses which resulted from type III infection were observed to occur in those areas in which the maximum number of organisms had accumulated. Evidence was obtained that suppuration was due, not to necrotoxic products peculiar to the type III pneumococcus, but rather to the survival of large numbers of bacteria in the tissues, brought about primarily by the antiphagocytic effect of the slime layer. When pneumonia was produced with an intermediate type III mutant lacking the protective slime layer, back mutation to the mucoid parent occurred during the course of the infection, and the mucoid form eventually predominated in the lung as a result of selective phagocytosis of the intermediate organisms. Similar mutation to the maximally virulent type III form was noted with a transformed intermediate type III strain grown from single cell preparations.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Pneumonia"],"pmid":"15422100","title":"Host-parasite relationships in experimental pneumonia due to pneumococcus type III.","year":"1950"},
{"abstractText":"The present experimental results concern primarily the question, whether or not mosquitoes feeding on chickens having viremia, as a result of the bite of infected mites, can acquire the virus of St. Louis encephalitis and whether or not mosquitoes thus infected, can transmit the virus to chickens and hamsters. During the course of the investigation, 7 species of mosquitoes of 3 genera were infected with the virus in one or two or all of three ways: by feeding on a suspension of infected mouse brain tissue, by feeding on chickens in which viremia had been produced by subcutaneous inoculation of virus, and by feeding on chickens having viremia as a result of the bite of infected mites. These mosquitoes transmitted the virus to chickens at periods varying from 5 to 33 days after the infective meal. The virus of St. Louis encephalitis was transmitted to hamsters by Culex pipiens at periods varying from 4 to 27 days after feeding on chickens having viremia as a result of the bite of infected mites. While viremia was demonstrated readily in hamsters, signs of encephalitis did not develop. In all transmission experiments the method of chorioallantoic passage proved necessary for the demonstration of viremia.

{"abstractText":"1. Eighteen known or possible metabolites of the hepatic carcinogen 4- (or p-) dimethylaminoazobenzene were tested for carcinogenic activity in the rat. Of these compounds only 4-monomethylaminoazobenzene, a known metabolite, proved to be active. Eight compounds, which appear to be metabolites of the dye, were inactive; these included 4-aminoazobenzene, 4'-hydroxy-4-monomethylaminoazobenzene, 4'-hydroxy-4-aminoazobenzene, N-methyl-p-phenylenediamine, p-phenylenediamine, aniline, p-aminophenol, and o-aminophenol. Nine compounds which may possibly be metabolites also were inactive; these compounds were 4'-hydroxy-, 3'-hydroxy-, and 2'-hydroxy-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene, 4-formylaminoazobenzene, 4-hydroxyazobenzene, 2, 4'-diamino-5-dimethylaminodiphenyl, 3-dimethylaminocarbazole, N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine, and p-hydroquinone. A mixture of 9 known and possible metabolites was also found to be inactive. These data indicate that the primary carcinogen operative in tumor formation by 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene is probably an azo dye closely related to the parent carcinogen. This conclusion is supported by recent work from this laboratory which indicates that the primary carcinogen consists of either or both of the protein-bound dyes found in the liver, i.e. 4-monomethylaminoazobenzene and an unidentified polar aminoazo dye, and that the formation of bound dye constitutes one of the first steps in this carcinogenic process. 2. The carcinogenic activities of 19 other compounds related to 4-dimethyl-aminoazobenzene were tested to obtain more information on the structural features needed for a 4-aminoazo dye to possess strong activity in the rat. 3'-Methyl-4-monomethylaminoazobenzene and the corresponding dimethylamino derivative were nearly twice as active and 4-ethylmethylaminoazobenzene had the same activity as 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene. As tested 3'-nitro- and 3'-chloro-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene both had about the same activity as 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene; however, since the 3'-nitro derivative was incompletely absorbed its real activity appears to be about 1(1\/2) times that of 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene. 2'-Nitro- and 2'-chloro-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene were about one-half to one-third as active and 4'-chloro-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene was approximately one-fourth as active as the parent dye. 3'-Ethoxy-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene and 3-methyl-4-monomethylaminoazobenzene exhibited only slight carcinogenic activity. The following compounds proved inactive: the benzamide of N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine; the diethyl, monoethyl, benzylmethyl, beta-hydroxyethylmethyl, and formyl derivatives of 4-aminoazobenzene on the amino group; and the 3-methyl, 3', 5'-dimethyl, 2',5'-dimethyl, and 2',4'-dimethyl derivatives of 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene. From the available data two conditions appear to be essential if a dye is to possess high activity: (1) at least one methyl group must be attached to the amino group together with the proper second substituent, and (2) the rings must bear either no substituents or carry only certain substituents, preferably in the 3' position. 3. The data on the carcinogenicity of the 2'-, 3'-, or 4'-methyl, chloro, and nitro derivatives of 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene show that the position of these groups determines the carcinogenicity of these compounds to a greater extent than does the type of group. The activity relationship was 3' > 2' > 4'. 4. Primary, secondary, and tertiary aminoazo dyes were determined in the livers and blood of rats fed aminoazo dyes which differed in the substituents on the amino group. The data show that deethylation of 4-diethyl-, 4-monoethyl-, and 4-ethylmethylaminoazobenzene occurs in vivo just as 4-dimethyl- and 4-monomethylaminoazobenzene are demethylated in vivo. However, 4-benzylmethylaminoazobenzene and 4-beta-hydroxyethylmethylaminoazobenzene were dealkylated only slightly under similar conditions. 5.

An epidemic of mild illnesses diagnosed as \"non-paralytic poliomyelitis\" and as \"summer grippe\" occurred during the summer of 1947 in Akron and Cincinnati, Ohio. From the pooled feces of such patients both poliomyelitis virus and C virus were obtained. From the samples of single patients, 3 immunologically related strains of C virus were isolated. One patient from whom virus was isolated had an illness which was diagnosed as non-paralytic poliomyelitis (with pleocytosis). Although poliomyelitis virus could not be isolated from this patient, previous tests (5) from similar non-paralytic patients in the same area revealed that 9 of 23 were infected with poliomyelitis virus. C virus could not be recovered from the stools of 3 of these poliomyelitis virus-infected patients. Four patients with an illness diagnosed as \"summer grippe\" were tested. Two harbored poliomyelitis virus of low virulence (4) as well as C virus, and two harbored poliomyelitis virus without any evidence of infection with C virus, either by virus isolation or by serological tests.

Neutralizing antibodies appeared within the first 5 days of disease (before complement-fixing antibodies) and increased in titer during the next 3 to 4 weeks.

{"abstractText":"The role of alkaline phosphatase in osteogenesis has been investigated by histochemical techniques with particular attention to its relationship to phosphate metabolism and matrix elaboration. The upper tibial epiphysis mainly, and other epiphyses as well of growing rabbits, and the costochondral junctions of newborn human beings were studied, as were bone grafts in growing rabbits. The findings in the newborn human beings were identical with those in the rabbits. Phosphatase activity and free phosphate localization do not universally coincide. The enzyme appears to be intimately related to preosseous cellular metabolism and to the elaboration of a bone matrix that is chemically calcifiable. It remains possible, however, that phosphatase may be in some way involved in making inorganic salts available to the calcifiable matrix. If this function does exist it is a secondary one, since the elaboration of bone matrix, which is always associated with phosphatase activity, can and does occur in the absence of calcification. Calcification may occur later, in the absence of the enzyme. There is evidence to suggest that cartilage matrix is utilized in the formation of bone matrix. Phosphatase is physiologically active only in the presence of living cells. Where it is demonstrable in the absence of living cells, as in the cartilage remnants of the metaphysis, it appears to be physiologically inactive. Since phosphatase is temporarily inactivated in weakly acid media, and readily reactivated by alkaline solutions it is possible that the enzyme might survive in a physiologically inactive state in weakly acid tissues, and yet remain capable of histochemical demonstration in vitro in an alkaline medium. Phosphatase is not related to the disappearance of chondroitin sulfate.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Bone and Bones","Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases"],"pmid":"14832392","title":"The role of alkaline phosphatase in osteogenesis.","year":"1951"},
{"abstractText":"Young, rapidly growing mice are greatly more responsive to the adenoma-inducing influence of urethane than are those just arriving at maturity. This is manifest both in the proportion of animals developing the tumors and in their number per individual. An amount of urethane per gram body weight which suffices to induce adenomas in only an occasional 8-week-old animal will cause them to appear in quantity in more than half the 3-week-old mice injected. There is an almost absolute inverse correlation between the rate of growth of the pulmonary tissue between the ages of 2 and 10 weeks and the response to urethane in terms of adenomas. Hence the conclusion seems justified that the natural proliferative activity of the alveolar cells during youth plays a major part in the formation of the tumors. After the 6th week the age differences become relatively slight, yet there is reason to think that they continue in some degree as life goes on. Urethane has no effect to promote multiplication of the cells it has rendered neoplastic, its whole role being to initiate neoplastic change. The abnormalities induced by urethane in the nucleus of normal and neoplastic cells, as observed by previous workers, have suggested that the substance brings about the adenomatous state by acting upon the nucleus. But colchicine, also a karyolytic poison causing pronounced nuclear changes, does not alter in the least the yield of adenomas to urethane when administered concurrently. Nor does fasting influence the yield, though it markedly reduces mitotic activity.

Radioautography of sections of bone and cartilage that had been fixed in formalin indicated that the tracer isotope was present throughout the entire epiphysis. Its concentration therein was highest initially at the epiphyseal-diaphyseal junction where the more mature cartilage cells were present. By the 96th hour post injection the sulfur-35 had become more uniformly distributed in the epiphyses and an even distribution of it throughout the epiphyseal cartilage was almost attained by the 216th hour post injection. As centers of secondary ossification arose in the epiphyseal cartilage, the sulfur-35 appeared to diminish in concentration and disappear from these loci. However, radioautographs of cartilage fixed in formalin saturated with barium hydroxide, instead of in formalin only, disclosed the fact that the tracer isotope was still present in these loci. When bone and bone marrow were fixed in formalin the autographs indicated the presence of sulfur-35 primarily in the periosteum. Only a negligible amount appeared to be present in the bone shaft and marrow.

{"abstractText":"Areas of rabbit skin previously rendered hyperplastic with turpentine were scarified, inoculated with the Shope papilloma virus, and covered with a dressing that contained 20-methylcholanthrene (MC) or 9:10-dimethyl-1:2-benzanthracene (9:10). The dressing was left on until healing had been well completed, a matter of 5 to 7 days. The papillomas which subsequently arose often appeared later, were fewer, and remained less vigorous than those due to the action of virus alone, but throughout several months they appeared to differ from these in no other ways. Then, more or less abruptly, the large majority became carcinomatous, frequently at several situations, whereas with few exceptions the control growths underwent no such alteration. The cancers were of the sorts ordinarily deriving, by secondary change, from epidermal cells infected with the virus. Collateral data have made plain that the hydrocarbons acted in their carcinogenic capacity to bring on the cancers. Indeed in control tests 9: 10 sometimes conferred latent neoplastic potentialities on uninoculated epidermis exposed to it while healing after scarification, a fact disclosed months later by painting these expanses with chloroform until hyperplasia occurred. Under the promoting influence of this agent papillomas formed which had the distinctive morphology of those induced by the chemical carcinogens. So strong and enduring were the effects of MC and 9:10 as to cause cancers to arise from many virus papillomas which were retrogressing after months of proliferation, that is to say under circumstances ordinarily unfavorable to malignant change.

{"abstractText":"There is a direct proportionality between the degree of adrenal and that of cardiac enlargement in experimental renal hypertension. This is evidence for the participation of the adrenal to an extent dependent on the severity of the hypertension as reflected in the degree of cardiac hypertrophy. The greater part of the weight increase of the adrenal is due to growth of the cortex. However, the relative degree of medullary growth exceeds that of cortical growth. There is evidence of medullary hyperplasia, but the cortical growth may be due to cell hypertrophy alone. In view of the known relationship between prolonged skeletal muscle work and the size of the adrenals, in which there is likewise a relatively greater growth of the medulla, the possibility that adrenal growth in experimental renal hypertension is a consequence of the metabolic demand of increased heart muscle work must be considered. The hyperplastic, hypertrophic medulla of the renal hypertensive rat is presumed to be producing increased amounts of a hormone whose action is not known. The adrenal medulla is not necessary for the development of moderate renal hypertension though this does not exclude the possibility that it may be involved somehow in the maintainance of the hypertensive state. Large, periodic-Schiff-positive, hyaline droplets are found in the cytoplasm of adrenal cortical cells with nuclear evidence of active function. There is some evidence that these indicate hypophyseal stimulation. Similar particles are found in the medulla, suggesting an interrelationship between the two parts of the adrenal.

By the administration of sublethal doses of sodium fluoroacetate which were found to increase the concentration of citrate in the mouse lung, it was possible to demonstrate a blocking of the citric acid cycle in that organ. Further, the intraperitoneal administration of these concentrations of fluoroacetate was found to inhibit markedly the propagation of influenza, Type A, virus in the lungs of mice. The inhibition was observed when the fluoroacetate was administered 15 minutes, 6 hours, or 12 hours after the mice were inoculated with virus. This effect was also demonstrable when the concentration of the viral inoculum was varied over a range of virus titers from 10(3.5) to 10(6.5).

{"abstractText":"The concurrent administration of compound E at a daily dosage of 2 mg. per kg. to rabbits receiving daily intracutaneous injections of crystalline egg albumin markedly inhibited the development of anaphylactic hypersensitivity of the Arthus type. ACTH, when given at a similar dosage, produced a much less marked effect. Both hormones suppressed circulating antibody and as with the Arthus reaction, the suppression produced by compound E was much greater than that obtained with ACTH. When treatment with compound E was started following sensitization, there was a rapid decline in circulating antibody and, if the pretreatment serum antibody was low, there was also a progressive decrease in skin reactivity, becoming negative after 5 days of treatment. When the pretreatment serum antibody concentration was great, so that by the termination of treatment the antibody concentration was still above the level ordinarily sufficient for a maximal skin response, the Arthus reaction was unaffected by treatment. These considerations as well as the failure of compound E to inhibit the systemic passive Arthus reaction suggest that the inhibitory effect of compound E and ACTH on the development of experimental hypersensitivity results from the hormonal reduction of circulating antibody. Treatment with compound E had no effect on the rate of disappearance of circulating antibody in the passively immunized rabbit. This finding suggests that ACTH and compound E reduce circulating antibody by inhibiting antibody formation rather than by promoting antibody destruction. The question is raised as to whether the marked lymphoid atrophy produced by these hormones may be related to the interference with antibody production.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Adrenocorticotropic Hormone","Cortisone","Hypersensitivity"],"pmid":"14861375","title":"The mechanism of action of 17-hydroxy-11-dehydrocorticosterone (compound E) and of the adrenocorticotropic hormone in experimental hypersensitivity in rabbits.","year":"1951"},
{"abstractText":"Guinea pigs were inoculated with the Vallée O type strain of the virus of foot-and-mouth disease. 42 to 48 hours after inoculation red blood cells washed in saline were found to be infective for normal guinea pigs suggesting that erythrocytes carry virus entities at the height of generalization of the disease. This infection is no longer obtained at 92 hours after inoculation when general symptoms of the disease decline. A replica-transfer technique was developed with which hemolyzed blood smears could be observed under the electron microscope. By direct examination and also shadow-casting with palladium, normal red cell membranes show only a very fine structure on the surface. Rounded masses of high electron density appear in the ghosts between 24 and 72 hours after inoculation with virus. The number and particularly the density of these masses tend to increase from 24 to 42 and 72 hours. In some cases they are disposed preferentially in single lines forming ring figures; in other cases they are distributed at random. At 42 hours after inoculation it was possible to detect dense particles of 20 to 70 mmicro. within the masses. Measurements of 100 masses at 72 hours gave results ranging from 116 to 437 mmicro with a mean diameter of 246 mmicro. Results based on 105 electron micrographs and on thousands of cells demonstrate that practically all red cell membranes contained dense masses 24 to 72 hours after inoculation. 92 hours after inoculation, coinciding with the disappearance of infectivity of the erythrocytes, the masses could no longer be seen and the membranes looked entirely normal.

{"abstractText":"At 37 degrees C., the attachment of T1 virus to its host cell in solution containing 10(-3)M CaCl(2) or 10(-2)M NaCl is extremely rapid (in the neighborhood of 100 per cent collision efficiency) and irreversible. At 1 degrees C., the attachment rate is almost equally rapid but largely reversible. If a suboptimal concentration of the necessary ions is employed when T2 virus attaches to host cells, the resulting binding is largely reversible, even at 37 degrees C. Reversible T2 attachment to host cells leaves the cell undamaged and capable of normal reproduction. Irreversible attachment results in death of the cell. Zn(++) exercises a specific inhibitory action on the invasion of E. coli B by T1 virus. The virus can still attach to the host cell at a rate closely approximating the maximum value, but the reaction remains reversible and the cell is protected against permanent damage. The protective action of the Zn against T1 invasion is exerted through an action on the cell, rather than on the virus. Studies of the uptake of radioactive Zn(65) show that cells become completely immune to T1 invasion when, on the average, 4 x 10(7) atoms of Zn have been taken up by each cell. Cells killed by ultraviolet irradiation still bind T1 at the maximum rate, but the reaction is reversible even when taking place at 37 degrees C., in optimum salt concentration. The tryptophane-deficient mutant of T4 bacteriophage requires its specific cofactor for the initial step of attachment to the host cell. These experiments support the picture previously developed that virus invasion of host cells consists in an initial, reversible attachment whose properties are those to be expected from the operation of electrostatic binding forces. The step is followed by an enzymatic transformation which is irreversible, strongly temperature-dependent, and in the case of T1 virus, susceptible to inactivation by ultraviolet radiation. The resistance of mutant cells to specific bacteriophages is of two types, depending on whether the first or second of these steps is blocked.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Viruses"],"pmid":"14861377","title":"The first two steps of the invasion of host cells by bacterial viruses.

{"abstractText":"Dogs with sustained anemia plus hypoproteinemia due to bleeding and a continuing low protein or protein-free diet containing abundant iron have been used in the present work to test food proteins and supplements as to their See PDF for Structure capacity to produce new hemoglobin and plasma proteins. The reserve stores of blood protein-producing materials are thus largely depleted in such animals and sustained levels of 6 to 8 gm. per cent hemoglobin and 4 to 5 gm. per cent plasma protein can be maintained for considerable periods of time. The stimulus of double depletion drives the body to use all protein building materials with the utmost conservation. This represents a severe biological test for food and body proteins and its assay value must have significance. Measured by this biological test in these experiments, casein stands well up among the best food proteins. The ratio of plasma protein to hemoglobin is about 40 to 50 per cent, which emphasizes the fact that these dogs produce on most diets about 2 gm. hemoglobin to 1 gm. plasma protein. The reason for this preference for hemoglobin production is obscure. The mass of circulating hemoglobin is greater even in this degree of anemia and the life cycle of hemoglobin is much longer than that of the plasma protein. Egg protein, egg albumin, and lactalbumin all favor the production of more plasma protein and less hemoglobin as compared with casein. The plasma protein to hemoglobin ratio is increased, sometimes above 100 per cent. Supplements to the above proteins of casein digests or several amino acids may return the response toward that which is standard for casein. Histidine as a supplement to egg protein increases the total blood protein output and brings the ratio of plasma protein to hemoglobin toward that of casein. Beef muscle goes to the other extreme and favors new hemoglobin production up to 4 gm. hemoglobin to 1 gm. plasma protein-a ratio of 25 per cent. The total amounts of new blood proteins are high. Lactalbumin as compared with casein shows a lower total blood protein output and a plasma protein to hemoglobin ratio of 70 to 90 per cent. Amino acid supplements are less effective. See PDF for Structure Fibrin is a good food protein in these experiments-much like casein. When fed over these 5 week periods it causes a sustained increase in blood fibrinogen. Folic acid in the doses given has no effect on the expected response to various diets. Peanut flour is a very poor diet for the production of new hemoglobin and plasma proteins. Small supplements of casein and beef show a significant response with improved output of blood proteins. Soy bean flour gives a poor response and wheat gluten a good response with adequate output of blood proteins. Visceral products show some variety. Beef heart is not as effective as beef muscle. Beef spleen, kidney, and pancreas give good responses but not up to casein. Pig stomach, beef brain, and calf thymus are below average.

{"abstractText":"The course of events in the solvation and reconstitution of collagen obtained from rat tail tendon is described as seen with the electron microscope. Under the influence of 0.01 per cent acetic acid the collagen fibers swell and dissociate into submicroscopic filaments, the smallest of which are probably beyond the resolution of the electron microscope. These filaments can be made to reconstitute into fibers either by the addition of neutral salts to the acid solution or by raising the pH. The structural form of the resulting fibers is influenced by the concentration of the salt and by the pH of the solution employed. Saline-concentrations around 1 per cent and pH's ranging from 4.8 to 6.8 lead to the formation of needle-shaped crystals, or tactoids, showing the striated structure characteristic of collagen. Saline concentrations outside of this range (0.5 per cent and 5.0 per cent) lead to the formation of long fibrils without evidence of striations. pH's on the alkaline side of 6.8 bring about the formation of long slender fibers. Some of the possible reasons for these different fiber forms are discussed. Apparently fibers are formed in vitro by the lateral and longitudinal association of the filaments seen in the original solutions. Some of the fibers thus formed may in turn associate laterally and longitudinally to form the larger fibers. The formation of the needle-shaped crystals appears to be an orderly process since it leads to the formation of a periodicity in the fibers. The striations in the smaller fibers are uniform and regularly spaced at around 210 A. With continued growth of these fibers there is a simultaneous development of a more obvious and precise banding. It is evident that two out of each group of three regularly spaced striae are more prominent.

The adsorption of these E. coli antigens is a function of the concentration of the antigen, the time (from 5 minutes to 2 hours) of treatment of the red blood cells with the antigen, and the concentration of the red blood cells used. 3.

Human cells treated with either or both antigens are still agglutinated by the homologous blood group (A, B, and Rh)-specific antibodies. 5.

Both sediment and supernate of a boiled E. coli suspension are capable of modifying red blood cells for E. coli hemagglutination; in contrast, the supernate obtained from an unboiled suspension and then heated does not modify red blood cells for hemagglutination, although it contains the antigen which can specifically adsorb E. coli antibodies, as shown by means of the hemagglutination and hemolysis inhibition tests. 7. Both the unheated and the boiled suspensions of E. coli O111 and O55 inhibit hemagglutination and hemolysis specifically. 8.

{"abstractText":"A series of embryonated eggs incubated from 6 to 18 days have been successfully infected by yolk sac inoculation with a strain of group A Coxsackie virus. The resulting pathologic changes are here described. The principal lesion consisted of widespread acute necrosis of striated muscle, apparently essentially identical in type and development with that characteristically produced by the virus in suckling mice. The infection was not itself lethal; some embryos with virtually complete destruction of skeletal muscle were found alive. The older the embryo at the time of inoculation, the less the severity and extent of the lesions; but susceptibility was sometimes not entirely lost in embryos 18 days old. Two embryos inoculated at this time hatched and lived for 4 and 11 days respectively. One showed minimal specific muscle lesions, and the other only some irregularity in muscle fiber size. The lessening of severity of the lesions was especially marked and abrupt in embryos inoculated on the 10th and the 12th day of incubation. In addition to the muscle lesions characteristic of infection with group A Coxsackie virus, there were regularly present in the more immature embryos extensive necrosis of epidermis and feathers and degeneration of feather follicles, believed to be probably a direct dermotropic effect of the virus infection. Other visceral lesions, chiefly liver necrosis, were occasionally observed but seemed not to have been due to direct virus action. As in suckling mice infected with group A Coxsackie virus, no lesions were observed in the central or peripheral nervous system nor in the heart muscle. No lesions deemed specific were seen in the few specimens of chorioallantoic membranes examined.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Enterovirus"],"pmid":"14946325","title":"The pathologic changes produced in chick embryos by yolk sac inoculation of group A coxsackie virus.","year":"1952"},
{"abstractText":"Sera from 81 patients with a diagnosis of paralytic or non-paralytic poliomyelitis, and from 159 individuals of similar age groups giving no history of the disease, were tested with a high titered, complement-fixing poliomyelitis antigen of Type 2 (Lansing-like). The antigen consisted of brain tissue from newborn mice injected with the MEF1 strain of virus as previously adapted to these animals. The presence or absence of Type 2 neutralizing antibody in the sera under test was found not to affect the complement fixation. Positive reactions were obtained with 57 per cent of the sera deriving from non-paralytic patients and in 70 per cent from paralytics, when the specimens were tested at a dilution of 1:16. The complement-fixing antibody was often present in highest titer as early as 24 hours after the onset of poliomyelitis, and in almost all instances within 7 days. In about half of the patients a 4-fold or greater drop in titer occurred within 3 months, with little or no change in the others. The incidence of titers of 1:16 or higher with the control sera varied with the season of the year at which they were procured, 3 per cent of the winter samples proving positive and 13 per cent of the summer. The tests of sera from the group of patients from whom poliomyelitis virus was recovered, disclosed no significant differences between those having the paralytic and those having the non-paralytic disease. Type 1 (Brunhilde-like) strains of virus were recovered from many of the patients yielding positive tests, although they presented no evidence of previous or concurrent infection with Type 2 virus. This finding shows that Type 1 virus can give rise in patients to Type 2 complement-fixing antibody. The application of these data to the serologic diagnosis of poliomyelitis infection in man will of necessity be limited until information is obtained on the development, persistence, and significance of complement-fixation reactions with antigens deriving from Type 1 and Type 3 poliomyelitis strains.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Poliomyelitis"],"pmid":"14946327","title":"Development, persistence, and significance of type 2, poliomyelitis complement-fixing antibody in man.","year":"1952"},

{"abstractText":"Ethylene oxide is an effective sterilizing agent for bacteriological broths, milk, and serum. A short time after it has exerted its sterilizing effect, the treated fluids again become capable of supporting bacterial growth. Ethylene oxide has been shown to destroy a number of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, aerobic and anaerobic spore-forming bacilli, fungi, and vaccinia virus. No organisms have been encountered which withstand its action. The quantity of ethylene oxide necessary for sterilization depends to some degree on the character of the medium sterilized. None of the materials tested required more than 1 volume per cent of liquid ethylene oxide. Ethylene oxide is highly reactive chemically, and its reactions with many of the components of complex biological fluids cannot be fully anticipated. Regardless of the chemical changes produced, ethylene oxide did not permanently alter the essential qualities of the growth factors in broth and milk which are required by fastidious organisms such as group A streptococci and others. However, its effect on the biological activity of any particular organic compound should be assayed before it can be assumed not to have a deleterious effect. The sterilization of media by ethylene oxide is accompanied by a rise in pH. Fluids which have a relatively high initial pH may require adjustment with sterile acid to return them to the optimal pH for bacterial growth. A mixture of ethylene oxide and broth was toxic to mice for 6 hours after admixture. Toxicity disappeared on incubating the mixture longer, and no residual toxicity could be demonstrated after 6 hours, even on repeated intraperitoneal inoculations.

{"abstractText":"The ears of young adult rabbits were painted with methylcholanthrene (MC) long enough to call forth a few benign tumors (papillomas, frill horns), and the animals were followed throughout their later lives. Soon after the paintings were stopped the tumors began to dwindle and vanished, yet even while they were disappearing other growths of the same kinds arose, only to vanish later in their turn. For a long while more arose than disappeared, and in consequence the number of tumors increased throughout years. They accumulated at a constant rate despite concurrent changes in the supporting skin, which might have been supposed, on previous experience, to have prevented this from happening. Only in the old age of the animals did the number of tumors eventually fall off, and by this time the skin on which they had arisen, long since normal in the gross to all appearance, had become nearly so microscopically. Even then latent neoplastic potentialities still existed in the cutaneous tissue; where punch holes were healing new tumors arose. A great multitude of hidden neoplastic cells were present in the MCed skin, and from them many of the growths called forth by the stimulus of healing undoubtedly derived. Yet the facts make it difficult to suppose that the long accumulation, at a constant rate, of tumors visible in the gross was due wholly to the proliferation of cells rendered neoplastic during the period of exposure to MC, and lying hidden afterwards for periods determined by their differing, evenly graded capabilities. Nor can the accumulation be attributed to a sustained carcinogenesis resulting from the pathological state of the skin. As a whole the findings indicate that the linear increase in growths was due for the most part to a continual arrival at the neoplastic state and subsequent proliferation of cells, or the descendants of cells, that had been no more than started on the way toward becoming neoplastic by the carcinogen. There is clinical evidence for such a course of events. Now and again a carcinoma arose from the skin previously treated with MC, but they were few in all, as would follow from the presence of local conditions unfavorable to malignant change.

In some instances infection did not progress further; in others it spread into the CNS with initial involvement of the trigeminal centers in the pons and medulla as early as the 4th day and by the 5th day was further advanced but still limited to the brainstem. Once infection was established it progressed both rostrally and caudally, at times with great rapidity, through the brainstem and reached the cord on the 6th or a later day. Incidental exposure in traumatized muscle of peripheral fibers of the VII motor nerve led in some instances to spread along that pathway directly into the CNS.

{"abstractText":"If genetically resistant and susceptible rabbits inhale a certain number of human type tubercle bacilli, no tuberculosis in the lungs of the resistant animals is seen, as a rule several months after infection, while there is a variable and often extensive disease in the susceptible rabbits. The analogy to the presence or absence of active tuberculosis in man infected with the tubercle bacillus is evident. The inhaled tubercle bacilli multiply for but a short time in the resistant rabbits and are usually rapidly and completely destroyed. In the susceptible rabbits, the bacilli multiply profusely for a much longer time and persist in large numbers even months after inhalation. Whatever be the cause of the more rapid destruction of tubercle bacilli in the resistant animal, the resulting more rapid release of the contained antigens enhances the development of allergic sensitivity and antibodies in these animals. The development of an acquired resistance against tubercle bacilli of the human type is sufficiently rapid to affect the genesis of the initial gross primary pulmonary foci that result from the inhalation of a given number of bacilli. The greater the genetic resistance, the fewer the initial primary foci. Variations in genetic resistance are essentially variations in the rate of development of acquired resistance. It is suggested that variations in genetic resistance to inhaled human type tubercle bacilli may affect the prevalence of alveolar phagocytes capable of acquiring adequate resistance to the growth of the bacilli in their cytoplasm.

By a process of exclusion, the findings give further support to the theory that lowered resistance to pneumococcal infection in influenzal pneumonia is due to edema fluid in the viral lesion furnishing a culture medium for inhaled pneumococci. A widely used method for evaluation of ciliary activity on respiratory epithelia has been the microscopic observation of wave-like movements in reflected light. This activity was observed readily in the bronchi of mice but evidence was obtained showing that at this site it was due to something other than ciliary beat. Further histopathologic observations were made in order to define the lesion of the bronchial epithelium that would permit sparing of ciliated cells. In addition to usual techniques, mice were injected with colchicine for estimation of the rate of cellular proliferation and were exposed to a large dose of roentgen rays to eliminate polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Stains for mucous and for mitochondria were done also. The evidence obtained favors the theory that the viral infection does not destroy any of the cells of the bronchial epithelium. Inclusion bodies were found in the cytoplasm, making it seem likely instead that viral particles grow in colony-like aggregations and that liberation of virus into the lumen takes place not only by simple extrusion of inclusions but also by detachment of inclusion-laden globular portions of the cytoplasm.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Bronchi","Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"14907969","title":"Effect of influenza virus on cilia and epithelial cells in the bronchi of mice.","year":"1952"},
{"abstractText":"In a study of the phagocytosis of staphylococci by human leukocytes it has been observed that strains of staphylococci producing human infection were phagocytized by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro under conditions in which virulent pneumococci, streptococci, or Klebsiella were rarely engulfed. In the presence of human leukocytes in plasma there was a rapid fall in the numbers of viable staphylococci of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains, the beginning of which was detectable in 10 to 15 minutes. The fall in culturable pathogenic microorganisms was considerably less marked, however, and a rapid resurgence of growth occurred in 4 to 8 hours, whereas the number of culturable non-pathogenic microorganisms remained low for 18 to 24 hours. These differences appear to be explained by the observation that a significant number of microorganisms of pathogenic strains were able to survive within human leukocytes. Such intracellular survival was found to be associated with evidence of destruction of the leukocytes. In contrast, non-pathogenic strains of staphylococci failed to survive within human polymorphonuclear leukocytes following ingestion.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Leukocytes","Micrococcus"],"pmid":"14907971","title":"The survival of staphylococci within human leukocytes.","year":"1952"},
{"abstractText":"The first known epidemic of poliomyelitis in Easton, Pennsylvania, occurred in 1949, and was unusual in the high proportion of paralytic to non-paralytic cases. Both poliomyelitis and Cosxackie, or C, viruses were isolated from more than half the patients studied during the acute stage of the disease. One month later C virus was only occasionally recovered. Classification of the 28 strains of C virus which were isolated revealed that 24 belonged to one antigenic type, Easton-2 (related to Albany type 1 virus). Patients from whom C virus was isolated showed a rise during convalescence to the Easton-2 or homologous type antibody. Two patients with paralytic poliomyelitis were studied for the quantitative development of antibodies to the poliomyelitis virus and to the C virus found in their stools. Using the neutralization test in monkeys and in newborn mice, respectively, a simultaneous rise in antibodies to both agents was observed. The situation at present can be summarized as follows:-Poliomyelitis virus or C virus may produce infection in man, with a specific antibody response. Both agents may be carried, particularly in the intestines, without causing any serious illness and healthy carrier states have been observed for each. Both viruses can be found in nature in flies and in sewage. However there has been no evidence to suggest that these two viruses bear a relationship to each other, even when isolated from the same patient. Thus, when both viruses are found in a patient with paralysis, it is not yet possible to say with any degree of accuracy to what extent each is responsible in the over-all pattern of the disease. How frequently dual infections of this nature may occur remains for future investigations to determine. Certainly all cases of poliomyelitis are not complicated by a superimposed infection with a C virus. However, this will have to be one more item to consider in epidemic poliomyelitis.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Poliomyelitis","Poliovirus"],"pmid":"14897994","title":"An epidemic of paralytic poliomyelitis characterized by dual infections with poliomyelitis and Coxsackie viruses.","year":"1951"},

According to the former, the enzyme appears to be almost entirely (95 per cent) located in the cytoplasm, while according to the latter, the acid phosphatase is predominantly concentrated in the nuclei and in some peribiliary polymorphic structures identified as myelin figures. It was found that the precipitaion pattern obtained in the histochemical test does not reveal, as generally assumed, differences in enzyme concentration among the various cell structures, but actually reveals differences in their lead phosphatase affinity. The usefulnes of the histochemical test for intracellular localization studies was found to be further limited by considerable fixation damage and formation of myelin figure artifacts.

{"abstractText":"Substances possessing the same histochemical properties as the ceroid in cirrhotic livers of rats fed choline-deficient diets have been prepared from various unsaturated fats, fatty acids and their esters by autoxidation but could not be obtained from hydrocarbons or saturated fats or fatty acids. The formation of ceroid-like substances occurred first on surfaces or at interfaces in the reaction mixtures. It was inhibited by antioxidants and was accelerated by the addition of tissues, blood cells, erythrocytic stroma, or hemoglobin, by emulsification, by increasing the surface exposed to the air, and by increasing the temperature. Histochemical studies provided much evidence that the following properties of ceroid might be attributed to the products of the autoxidation of unsaturated lipids: insolubility in organic solvents, sudanophilia, yellowing by concentrated nitric acid, positive periodic acid-Schiff's reaction, basophilia, acid fastness, positive hernofuscin reaction, and reduction of diammine silver carbonate and alkaline potassium permanganate. The normal reactivity of cells or tissues embedded in ceroid was effectively masked by the pigment, apparently, initially at least, by preventing the reagents' gaining access to them. It is suggested that the iron sometimes demonstrated in ceroid may be that of blood cells or tissue fragments incompletely masked by the ceroid. It is concluded that whenever conditions are such that unsaturated fats accumulate in tissues to such an extent that a relative lack of biological anti-oxidants results, autoxidation of the fats and their conversion to ceroid pigment are favored, and that ceroid and the lipofuscin pigment of vitamin E deficiency may be fundamentally similar.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Liver Cirrhosis","Pigments, Biological"],"pmid":"14897999","title":"The in vitro preparation and histochemical properties of substances resembling ceroid.","year":"1951"},

A severe demyelinating condition characterized by ataxia and paralysis, in some instances leading to death, was produced in thirty-five of a total of fifty-five dogs following immunization with homologous brain tissue combined with Freund's adjuvants. In more than 30 per cent of instances paralysis did not occur until immunization was continued for 6 or more months. Only eight dogs became paralyzed after a single injection of antigen. The condition appeared between 6 and 15 days after the last injection in all animals, irrespective of the total number of injections or the duration of immunization. 2. An antibody which reacted in complement fixation tests with aqueous and alcoholic extracts of homologous brain tissue was demonstrable in the majority of immunized dogs, whether or not the animals became paralyzed. It appeared during or after the 3rd week of immunization, and its occurrence or titer could not be correlated with the incidence of the encephalomyelitis. In general, there were fewer dogs with demonstrable antibody in the paralyzed group than in the non-paralyzed group. 3. A flocculation reaction with alcohol extracts of homologous brain was demonstrated in the serum of immunized dogs. The antigen and antibody involved were apparently identical with those responsible for the complement fixation reactions. 4. The brain tissue component which reacted as antigen in the complement fixation test was present in adult brain from several mammalian species, and peripheral nerve. It was not present in the brain of newborn dogs nor in other unrelated organs. It was demonstrable in brain tissue which had been allowed to autolyze, or treated with 10 per cent formalin. It was not impaired by boiling, or by acid hydrolysis, and was contained in the unsaponifiable fraction of brain lipids. It was separable from cholesterol by digitonin precipitation of the latter. 5.

This is largely due to improvements in the older methods of investigation and to the invention of new ones. Among the latter may be mentioned the microelectrode technique of Granit and the retinal direction effect of Stiles and Crawford. Modern requirements are met by a polychromatic theory, comprising 7 types of receptor, but there is no necessity for these to have such narrow spectral response curves as those exhibited by Granit's modulators. Modifications of the three- and four-color theories have been examined to see to what extent they can be made to fit in with experimental results. Particular notice has been taken of the possibility that there is polychromatism of the retinal receptors, but trichromatism of the nerve paths which connect these to the brain or even of the brain itself.

In the presence of fatty acids, the growth of dysgonic strains is increased by the addition of small amounts of glucose or glycerol, whereas large amounts of glucose or glycerol decrease the total growth and inhibit or retard the growth of small inocula.

Murine-adapted strains of poliomyelitis virus and murine encephalomyelitis virus could not be detected beyond the 5th day, even though comparable amounts of virus were fed. The persistence of C virus excretion (2 to 12 days) varied directly with the amount of virus fed. Poliomyelitis virus, as present in human stools, survived drying and storage at room temperature for at least 3 days and at 4 degrees for 3 weeks. C virus from human stools under the same circumstances was detected for 15 days at room temperature (with marked drop in titer after the 3rd day) and for 21 days at 4 degrees with little loss in titer. When stool samples were fed to flies and the dried excreta of the insects examined, it was found that (a) poliomyelitis virus persisted for at least 1 to 2 days at room temperature and for 3 to 4 days at 4 degrees , and (b) C virus persisted for 1 day at room temperature and for 5 days at 4 degrees .

Its activity is not destroyed by trypsin, chymotrypsin, or ribonuclease. No evidence of plasma activator or inhibitor was detected. Significant temperature elevation in the rabbit was effected by a quantity of leukocyte extract containing 0.76 mg. protein and 0.054 mg. polysaccharide. The febrile response produced by the material under study was compared with that of Menkin's pyrexin as well as with that of bacterial pyrogens. Several significant differences were noted. The properties of pyrexin are similar to those of bacterial pyrogens. Amidopyrine suppressed the febrile response to injection of leukocyte extracts, whereas neither amidopyrine nor cortisone influenced the appearance of pyrogenic material in induced peritoneal exudates. Peritoneal fluids collected from rabbits made leukopenic by HN(2) were found to contain a fever-promoting substance. Its character has yet to be determined.

Solutions of it gave a positive diazo reaction, and, as determined electrophotometrically, gave maximum absorption of light having a wavelength of 425 mmicro, being identical in these properties with chloroform solutions of crystalline mesobilirubin. Experimental kernicterus was regularly induced by injecting crystalline mesobilirubin intracerebrally in newborn kittens, the pigment staining the cerebral tissues a bright canary-yellow and being deposited abundantly in the nerve cells, as microscopic examinations showed, although these latter were otherwise intact. Bilirubin, likewise injected intracerebrally in newborn kittens, had no such effects. The possibility is discussed that the blood-brain barrier is altered in some infants with hyperbilirubinemia in such a way that bilirubin crosses it and is then reduced within the brain to mesobilirubin thus giving rise to the cerebral pigmentation of kernicterus.

DSCl and DSCN, together with 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonate (DSO(3)), constitute a clearly defined group of allergenic dinitrophenyl compounds in that they all combined with skin protein in vivo through reaction with cysteine or cystine. In vitro, these compounds combine with free SH groups, and with -S-S- groups of hair and epidermis, but not with -S-S- groups of oxidized glutathione or of bovine gamma globulins. DSO(3), DSCl, and DSCN did not react with amino groups in vivo, but did react with protein amino groups in vitro at pH values of about 10. Another group of dinitrophenyl compounds (DF, DCl, and DBr) previously had been shown to combine with lysine epsilon-NH(2) groups of epidermal proteins. In the present work it was found that these compounds do not react with the disulfide groups of these proteins, either in vivo or in vitro. Moreover, they did not seem to react with SH groups of viable skin, although they are highly reactive with sulfhydryl in vitro. This apparent discrepancy between reactivity with SH groups in vitro and in vivo may be due to the fact that the chromatographic technique employed was relatively insensitive for the sulfhydryl derivative. When a compound of either group was applied to the skin surface, dinitrophenyl-amino acids were recovered from the epidermis but not from the dermis.

Utilization of quantitative absorption technics allows the simultaneous detection of variable quantities of several different antigens so that the antigenic composite of the strain is more clearly defined than was previously possible. The wide sharing of antigenic components leads to the conclusion that no completely new antigens have formed of late nor have the antigenic components of strains isolated several years ago disappeared.

{"abstractText":"The effects on the antibody content of the population which result from repeated exposure to antigenic variants of influenza viruses have been studied by measuring, with many strains, the antibody content of lots of gamma globulin prepared in different years and the patterns of antibody found in sera collected in 1 year from various age groups. In all samples of gamma globulin collected from 1943 through 1951, high levels of antibody were found with strains of Type A and Type B influenza viruses isolated prior to 1941. The highest levels were found in the more recent collections of gamma globulin. Antibodies to A-prime, and to B strains of 1945 and 1952, were present at low levels in gamma globulin collected prior to the isolation of these viruses. A moderate increase in antibody was observed in the gamma globulin of recent years. The pattern of distribution of antibody by age found with most A-prime strains in serum pools exhibited high levels in infancy and childhood, but after the age of 20, little or no antibody was detected. With Type A strains antibody was usually not observed until the 11th year of age. Thereafter, high levels were present until age 20, when the amount of antibody declines to a moderate and relatively constant level which persists throughout life. Antibody against swine influenza virus did not become detectable until the 29th year. The intermediate antigenic character of a few A-prime isolates was reflected in the antibody pattern obtained with them. Antibody was not found until age 13 with the Lee (1940) strain of Type B influenza virus, but thereafter the level was high. With the type B isolates of 1945 and 1952, antibody became measurable at earlier ages. The present data clearly demonstrate that in the early years of life the range of the antibody spectrum is narrow, and that it becomes progressively broader in later life. A striking correlation was found between what is known of the periods of prevalence of certain strains of influenza viruses and the age of the people in whom strain-specific antibodies are currently found. It has been observed that the age at which antibodies to certain strains are first detectable has progressively advanced with the passage of time. From these data the following immunologic thesis is formulated. The antibody which is acquired during the initial infections of childhood is of limited scope and reflects the dominant antigens of the prevailing strains. The immunity conferred by the initial experiences with influenza is also limited. Successive experiences later in life with viruses of related but differing antigenic make-up result in a composite of antibody which is oriented toward a larger number of the common antigens which comprise influenza virus. These experiences confer a broader immunity which limits infection with, and antibody response to, the more recently encountered strains. The antibody-forming mechanisms appear to be oriented by the initial infections of childhood so that exposures later in life to antigenically related strains result in a progressive reinforcement of the primary antibody. The highest cumulative antibody levels detectable in a particular age group tend, therefore, to reflect the dominant antigens of the virus responsible for the childhood infections of that group. Hence the pattern of antibody distribution determined currently in different age groups provides a serologic recapitulation of past infection with antigenic variants of influenza viruses.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Antibodies","Antigens","Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"13109114","title":"Epidemiologic and immunologic significance of age distribution of antibody to antigenic variants of influenza virus.","year":"1953"},

A similar group of phages have been isolated directly from a culture of B. megatherium 899a in this laboratory.

{"abstractText":"A study was made of the intracellular localization of Type 2 poliomyelitis virus, using the technique of Mirsky and Pollister (23) for cellular fractionation. After isotonic saline homogenization of central nervous system tissue from infected mice, and subsequent centrifugation of the suspension, the virus present in the supernatant fluid was held to be of cytoplasmic origin. Upon serial washings of the sediment with physiological saline, the resulting supernates contained progressively less virus until by the seventh washing, virtually none was present. At this point extraction of the washed sediment with molar NaCl, which lyses the nuclei, yielded substantial amounts of virus, and this was assumed to be from nuclear sources. The possibility has not been excluded however that the \"nuclear\" sediment was contaminated by cytoplasmic particles too large to remain in the supernate. Experiments on the increase of virus during the incubation and acute stages of infection have revealed that it was first detectable in the \"cytoplasmic\" fraction and subsequently in the \"nuclear\" fraction. Virus in the \"nuclear\" fraction from paralyzed mice sometimes reached titers almost as high as those found in the \"cytoplasm.\" Adsorption experiments indicated that the \"nuclear\" fraction of CNS tissue from normal, uninoculated mice did not adsorb added Type 2 poliomyelitis virus, nor did such fractions adsorb virus procured from the \"cytoplasm\" or \"nuclei\" of infected cells. Although individual mice varied in their response after virus injection, the \"cytoplasmic\" fraction of paralytic mice was found to contain virus regularly, whereas little more than half of the non-paralytic mice yielded it. When virus was present in the \"cytoplasm,\" it could be found in the \"nuclear\" fraction of paralytic mice with much greater regularity than in that of non-paralytic mice. A comparison between the lines of the MEF1 strain of poliomyelitis virus, \"adapted\" and \"non-adapted\" to newborn mice, and the Lansing strain, revealed no differences in their intracellular increase.

Quantitative determinations of the numbers of living bacilli present in the tissues at different intervals of time after infection led to the following classification of the cultures tested:- (a) Certain well known variant forms of tubercle bacilli were found to be unable to multiply in vivo, although they could survive for many weeks in the tissues of mice. These organisms proved to be truly avirulent. (b) Other variant forms underwent multiplication in vivo, even when extremely small infective doses were used, but could not give rise to progressive disease. It is proposed to designate these strains, which produce only abortive infections, as \"attenuated.\" Different levels of attenuation could be detected. The maximum numbers of living bacilli that were recovered from the tissues corresponded directly to the severity and duration of the abortive lesions that could be produced by the strain in guinea pigs or in mice and were characteristic for each strain tested. The two BCG substrains tested were found to differ markedly in their level of attenuation. (c) The cultures virulent for guinea pigs were also capable of establishing a progressive infection in mice even when small infective doses were used. In the case of the attenuated and virulent strains, the population of living bacilli present in the lungs was at first much lower than that in the spleen, but it continued to increase in the former organs throughout the period of observation. This was notably true in the case of the virulent cultures. In contrast, the numbers of living bacilli in the spleen rapidly reached a maximum in the case of all cultures and then decreased progressively.

It was possible to prevent or retard the development of immunity by treating the mice in course of immunization with a drug, isoniazid, capable of interrupting the multiplication in vivo of the bacilli used as vaccine. Although immunity regularly developed and lasted for many weeks when the proper conditions of vaccination were used, the immune response was never sufficient to protect the animals against ultimate death from infection with virulent tubercle bacilli. The prolongation of life in the vaccinated mice was not consequent on a direct bactericidal effect but rather on a retarded or interrupted multiplication of the virulent bacilli in vivo.

Since rabbits reinjected with BGG 3 to 4 months after irradiation did not give an accelerated response, the BGG must not have been retained over the period of time necessary for recovery; i.e., less than 2 months.

{"abstractText":"Sheep serum and bovine serum contain an enzyme which brings about a rapid oxidative deamination of certain biological amines. This enzyme differs from previously described amine oxidases in several regards and especially in its substrate specificity. Studies thus far indicate that only spermine and the closely related compound spermidine serve as substrates for the enzyme in sheep serum. For this reason, the enzyme has been named spermine oxidase. Spermine oxidase is active in a variety of fluids of various ionic strength and buffer composition. The reaction takes place between pH 6.0 and pH 8.0 with an optimal rate in the vicinity of neutrality. Under certain conditions, the rate of oxygen consumption during the initial phase of the reaction is independent of the concentration of substrate. The diminution in rate observed during the latter phase of the enzymatic attack appears to be due to an alteration in the kinetics at low concentrations of substrate, or to competitive inhibition by a product of the reaction. Carbonyl reagents almost completely block the action of spermine oxidase, while certain amines and the cyanide ion bring about partial inhibition. Thiol reagents and sequestering compounds do not alter the course of the oxidative process. In the presence of low concentrations of mercuric chloride, the sheep serum-spermine system consumes approximately twice as much oxygen as controls containing no mercuric ion.

{"abstractText":"Previous workers have found that the concentration of urea in human sweat exceeds the concentration of urea in plasma. This fact has been confirmed in the present work and extended by measurements of the concentrations of urea in the sweat and the corresponding concentrations of urea in the plasma over a range of 25- fold variation in the latter. An analysis of the data showed that the ratio of the concentration of urea in sweat to the concentration of urea in plasma, S\/P, was independent of the plasma concentration, independent of the absolute flux of urea or water, and independent of the calculated energy expenditure. Two experiments showed that the concentration of urea in sweat followed a rising concentration in plasma with a time lag of approximately 5 minutes; this fact indicates that the accumulation of urea in sweat is a continuous process which is in operation during the observed discharge. These observations suggest that urea is carried into the gland in some precursor solution and subsequently raised to a higher concentration by the reabsorption from this solution of a constant fraction of the water.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Blood","Sweat","Urea"],"pmid":"13052810","title":"Urea excretion in human sweat as a tracer for movement of water within the secreting gland.","year":"1953"},

This phenomenon appears to be a regular occurrence in experimental animals, and is similar to that found in two other neurotropic infections, rabies and Borna disease. Viremia appears to be secondary to primary neural infection. The presence of virus in the lumen of the alimentary tract appears to be secondary to primary neural infection and not to viremia, and to be associated with the centrifugal spread of virus in peripheral nerves. The presence of virus in \"extraneural\" tissues is not per se referable to infection of their constituent cells but rather to infection of their supplying nerves or, in some instances, to their content of virus-bearing blood. The finding of virus in the vagus nerve may throw light on some of the electrocardiographic changes noted in certain cases of human poliomyelitis.

Each exhibits the presence of the type specific polysaccharides of 2 types of E. influenzae within the same cell. In Sab the polysaccharides of types a and b have been demonstrated and in Sad those which characterize types a and d. The Sab and Sad traits are inherited. Sab was produced by the action of DNA-containing extract isolated from type a on either type b cells or Rb cells (non-encapsulated non-type-specific cells derived from type b). Sad cells were formed as a result of the action of the DNA-containing extract isolated from type d on cells intermediate between Rab and Sab cells. DNA-containing extracts isolated from Sab cells have induced the Sab trait in Rd cells with predictable regularity. Evidence has been presented that the hereditary determinant of Sab cells is a new genetic substance with new functions. Therefore, the interaction of the DNA-containing substance from cells of one genetic type with living cells of a genetically different type has produced what appears to be a new individual which differs from each of the cells contributing the differing genetic traits but has at least one trait in common with each.

Osmotic pressure maintained by pancreas or submaxillary gland, as ascertained in the same way, remains unchanged during (1\/2) hour and later increases.

Low protein diet has been found to depress osmotic pressure of liver cells after about 4 weeks, and with degenerative changes in the parenchyma, notably fatty infiltration, this pressure has remained at a diminished level during approximately 90 days. Increase of pressure within the common bile duct and the changes following biliary obstruction are accompanied by depression of the osmotic pressure maintained by liver tissue and ligation of the ureter diminishes the osmotic pressure maintained by kidney tissue. In both instances osmotic pressure tends later to rise to its former level.

The addition of streptokinase to human serum, which converts plasminogen to plasmin, also causes the inactivation of complement components C'2 and C'4 and varying amounts of C'1. C'3 is the most resistant to inactivation by plasmin. Chloroform-activated human plasmin and bovine plasmin also destroy these components of complement, but are less effective than the streptokinase-activated enzyme. The inactivation of complement by the addition of streptokinase to human serum is inhibited by high hydrogen ion concentrations, low temperature, and elevated ionic strength. The inactivation of the components of complement in various fractions of serum is influenced by the available plasminogen and the content of plasmin inhibitors in these fractions. Certain similarities are pointed out between the components of complement and the factors in the plasmin system and between the inactivation of the components of complement by antigen-antibody reactions, by specific agents, and by plasmin.

{"abstractText":"Helenine is moderately stable in solution at refrigerator temperature and can be kept for long periods of time without evident loss of activity if stored frozen at the temperature of solid CO(2). It is filterable through a Seitz pad but not dialyzable. Crude SPS preparations of helenine do not lose activity when dried from the frozen state. Some conditions are described, however, which influence the preservation or inactivation of acetone-precipitated helenine when freeze-dried. Helenine is partially inactivated by exposure for 3 minutes to the temperature of a boiling water bath and is completely inactivated by autoclaving at 15 pounds' pressure for 15 minutes. The data presented suggest that helenine acts, either directly or by triggering some mechanism of the host itself, to destroy virus by a process which renders the latter non-antigenic. This effect may be exerted by action upon the virus itself or by interference with some stage in the developmental cycle of the virus. While the chemical nature of helenine is not known, the presence of a large proportion of polysaccharide in crude active preparations might suggest the possible importance of this class of substance in helenine activity. It is believed that helenine differs from the polysaccharide reported by Horsfall and McCarty and the penicillin impurity reported by Groupé and Rake to be active against certain viruses.

The histological effects produced by this agent over a wide range of dose levels were nearly identical in character and differed principally in their speed of evolution. The deposition of calcium always began at foci in the cytoplasm of the cells of the proximal convoluted tubules of the inner cortex. It remained intracellular until the cell boundaries were destroyed. Deposits of calcium could be found before any other cellular damage could be demonstrated by histological examination. Later, when degeneration and necrosis were present, the foci of calcification were imperfectly related to them in location or degree. In contrast, the amount of calcification was correlated with the dose of uranium nitrate, being greatest in the kidneys of rats that received 20 mg.\/kg., next greatest in the 30 mg.\/kg. rats, less in the 10 mg.\/kg. rats, and slight in those that received 2 mg.\/kg. Histochemical stains for ferric and ferrous iron, chondroitinsulfate, and polysaccharides gave results that were negative or unrelated to the deposits of calcium, thus making it unlikely that these substances held any appreciable amount of calcium in the tissue. Yet it is clear that some anion other than phosphate must be combined with part of the calcium; the results with the alizarin and von Kóssa stains confirmed an earlier result (1) in showing that the first deposits of calcium are formed without comparable accumulations of phosphate.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Kidney","Uranium"],"pmid":"13052827","title":"The stages in calcification of the rat kidney after the administration of uranium nitrate.","year":"1953"},

{"abstractText":"The injection into the dorsal skin of a suspension of guinea pig testis or spermia incorporated in a water-in-oil emulsion containing killed mycobacteria induces aspermatogenesis in guinea pigs. The injury begins with the inhibition of the maturation of spermia and proceeds through the degeneration and exfoliation of spermatids, spermatocytes, and finally spermatogonia. These germinal cells pass from the seminiferous tubules into the epididymis. The process is not associated with inflammation. No significant changes occur in the intertubular spaces and the Leydig cells do not seem to be affected. The seminal vesicles and the prostate remain normal. The aspermatogenesis may begin in 10 days and it lasts for more than 5 months. The process may lead to atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and fibrosis. Guinea pigs which receive a suspension of their own testis or spermia and adjuvants develop a similar injury. The \"mitochondrial\" fraction of the testis of guinea pig is effective while repeated injections of alcoholic extract of testis emulsified with paraffin oil containing mycobacteria do not cause aspermatogenesis. The presence of acid-fast bacilli in the water-in-oil emulsion containing testis or spermia seems to be essential for the production of testicular lesions; the injection of antigen and mycobacteria into different sites is ineffective. When guinea pig testis is replaced by guinea pig liver or kidney or rabbit testis no testicular damage occurs. The injection of rabbit spinal cord combined with adjuvants results in allergic encephalomyelitis in a large proportion of guinea pigs, accompanied by a great loss of weight. The testes of a few of these animals show a varying degree of aspermatogenesis. When guinea pig brain is combined with adjuvants and administered subcutaneously the incidence of testicular injury is high, although the damage is, in general, mild. From the standpoint of mechanism, the inhibition of spermatogenesis which occurs in these animals may be unrelated to the injury which follows the injection of germinal cells. Aspermatogenesis follows the injection of killed mycobacteria in paraffin oil into the testis as well as into certain sites related to the gonad: the abdominal cavity, the subcutaneous tissue over the abdomen, and the skin of the inguinal region. Antibodies fixing complement in the presence of spermia are demonstrable in the sera of guinea pigs injected with testis or spermia and adjuvants. When the mycobacteria are omitted the titers are low and no testicular injury occurs. Although there seems to be a correlation between testicular damage and complement-fixing titer, this may not be a causal relationship.

{"abstractText":"Fifteen minutes after intraperitoneal injection of sulfur-35 as sodium sulfate to 7-day-old rats the concentration of the isotope was highest in the cartilage at the epiphyseal-diaphyseal junction of long bones but was demonstrable throughout the entire epiphysis. Up to the 24th hour the pattern of deposition did not change as the concentration continued to increase. As centers of secondary ossification developed, there occurred in them an increased concentration of some form of sulfur, insoluble as the barium salt. This sulfur was probably derived from the cartilage which the center of secondary ossification replaced. Up to about the 30th minute after injection the sulfur-35 was deposited transitorily in a high concentration in discrete loci of the bone marrow. Excluding this transitory deposition, the highest concentration of the radioisotope in the bone marrow was seen in the specimens removed 24 hours after administration. In the bone shaft the sulfur-35, in a form which was insoluble in an alkaline solution of barium ions, was deposited diffusely up to the 24th hour after its administration. Thereafter, the radioisotope decreased in concentration in the middle portion of the bone shaft.

{"abstractText":"Simultaneous autologous and homologous musculofascial transplants were made in New Zealand white rabbits. The basic pattern of degeneration and granulation tissue organization of both types of transplant was essentially identical. The superposition of two reactions in the framework of organizing granulation tissue served to distinguish homologous from autologous transplants. One reaction to homologous transplants was predominantly characterized by lymphocytic infiltration and the other by angeitis. The principal locus of these reactions was in the musculofascial zone of the transplant, and from this zone the reactions spread to a variable degree through the fascia into the overlying pannus of granulation tissue. When single homologous transplants were made, the lymphocytic and mild angeitic forms of reaction predominated, becoming conspicuous at the end of 2 weeks. When multiple successive homologous transplants were made from the same donor to the same recipient, acute angeitis with thrombosis supervened and the lymphocytic reaction failed to develop or persist. Multiple successive autologous transplants, on the other hand, did not influence the type or degree of reaction to autologous transplants in the same animal. There was no evidence that autologous transplants had any influence upon the sequence of reactions to homologous transplants or that the presence of homologous transplants influenced the nature of the reaction to autologous transplants in the same animal.

{"abstractText":"A series of sulfonamide compounds, para-aminohippurate, and inulin were used to study the permeability of the epithelium of human sweat glands. Inulin was not excreted in the sweat. The ratios of the concentrations in sweat to the concentrations in plasma, S\/P, of sulfanilamide, sulfapyridine, sulfathiazole, sulfadiazine, and para-aminohippurate were found to be 0.69, 0.58, 0.13, 0.11, and 0.02 respectively, independent of the plasma concentrations and the sweating rates. The fact that the S\/P ratios are thus unaffected by the absolute number of molecules transported suggests that these compounds enter into the sweat by simple diffusion and not via a specific secretory mechanism which could become saturated by increasing load. If this is so, the difference in the S\/P ratios must be explained by an unequal permeability of the epithelium of the sweat gland to the various compounds and some explanation for these differences in the rate of excretion must exist in terms of physicochemical properties of the compounds. A comparison between the S\/P ratios and the pK values of the various sulfonamides indicates that the differences in their rates of excretion in the sweat depend upon the degree of ionization of the various compounds at the physiological pH.

Injection of virus suspensions by the intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, or intracerebral route is followed by selective necrosis of the pancreas. 4. The liver, in the earlier stages of the disease, is the seat of fat infiltration. There may be necrosis of individual hepatic cells, but the diffuse hepatitis described in suckling mice does not occur. In the later stages of the disease, the liver is not significantly altered. 5. Localized areas of fat necrosis, scattered through intra-abdominal adipose tissue, are usually present in the acute phase of the disease. These undergo fibrosis without calcification. 6. No lesions have been found in the skeletal muscle, even at the site of intramuscular injection. Central nervous system, heart, lungs, and peripheral fat lobules show no lesions comparable to those described in suckling mice. 7. Multiplication of virus takes place in the pancreas. Serial passage in adult mice, by injection of pancreas suspensions prepared from organs removed on the 4th day after infection, is readily accomplished. Five consecutive passages in adult mice have thus far been carried out. Pancreas suspension from 4th passage material produced typical disease in suckling mice when diluted 10(-6).

Sera which contain only non-precipitating antitoxin exhibit most of the properties of atopic reagin-containing sera. This type of antitoxin is capable of sensitizing normal human skin to toxin or toxoid and remains for many weeks in the injected area. It exhibits no Danysz effect, does not fix complement unless very large amounts of serum are used, and can be specifically coprecipitated by addition of precipitating antitoxin and toxin. On the other hand, it is capable of sensitizing guinea pigs to fatal anaphylactic shock. Heating at 56 degrees C. for 4 hours destroys the skin-sensitizing properties and results in almost quantitative conversion to a modified antitoxin which is capable of blocking the wheal and erythema reaction caused by injection of toxoid into sensitized skin. Heating at 56 degrees C. does not result in an appreciable loss of neutralizing power as judged by tests in rabbit and human skin. The anaphylactogenic property of nonprecipitating antibody is likewise unaffected by heat at 56 degrees C. 3. Precipitating antitoxin is incapable of sensitizing normal skin to toxin or toxoid and disappears rapidly from the injected sites. It fixes complement to high titer and sensitizes guinea pigs to fatal anaphylactic shock. It was possible to demonstrate inhibition of the wheal and erythema reaction in sensitized skin by injecting certain mixtures of precipitating antitoxin and toxoid. 4.

{"abstractText":"The intrarenal interstitial pressure was measured during the course of experimental renal hypertension in dogs. In perinephritic hypertension, produced by wrapping the kidney in a cellophane bag, the intrarenal pressure rose slowly from the normal value of 25 mm. Hg to a final level of about 60 mm. Hg. Strong pressure pulsations were observed in the renal parenchyma during this type of hypertension. In the hypertension following partial occlusion of the renal artery, the intrarenal pressure remained approximately normal, except in malignant hypertension when it tended to decline to about 9 mm. Hg. The hypertension of perinephritis is interpreted as a consequence of renal ischemia, the high intrarenal pressure, produced by the constricting fibrotic hull, acting to reduce the effective perfusion pressure of the kidney. The two experimental hypertensions herein examined are considered as examples of influent resistance hypertensions and effluent resistance hypertensions, the former being due to renal arterial or arteriolar resistance and the latter due to renal venous resistance, specifically at the arcuate-interlobar junction. The application of this concept to renal hypertensive disease in man is discussed.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Hypertension"],"pmid":"12981213","title":"The intrarenal pressure during experimental renal hypertension.","year":"1952"},

{"abstractText":"It was shown, by means of salt fractionation procedures and electrophoresis that a marked and sustained hyperglobulinemia regularly resulted when sodium ribonucleate was injected subcutaneously at frequent intervals into rabbits undergoing immunization with horse serum. The hyperglobulinemia was characterized by a large increase in the gamma globulin levels, and a slight increase in the alpha and beta globulin levels. In control experiments done concurrently, the immunization of rabbits with horse serum, accompanied by subcutaneous injections of saline instead of ribonucleate, resulted in only moderate elevations in gamma globulin levels, while injections of ribonucleate alone brought about slight elevations in all three globulin components in some of the animals. Precipitin tests showed that the rabbits immunized with horse serum and simultaneously treated with ribonucleate developed antibody titers against horse serum that were no higher than those of the immunized controls given saline instead of ribonucleate. Indeed, some of the animals treated with horse serum and ribonucleate had globulin levels that were much higher and had antibody titers that were significantly lower than were those of several rabbits receiving horse serum and saline. Injections of ribonucleate alone did not result in the formation of specific antibodies detectable by means of precipitin tests. The results made it plain that the hyperglobulinemia of the animals treated with horse serum and ribonucleate was not due to an excessive production of specific antibodies. The findings as a whole provide further evidence that nucleotides play an important role in the formation of proteins in animals, and they indicate that an abnormally increased utilization of ribonucleotides by cells capable of producing globulins may be a causative factor in the pathogenesis of hyperglobulinemia.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Nucleic Acids","Serum Globulins"],"pmid":"12981218","title":"Experimental hyperglobulinemia; the effect of injected ribonucleotide on serum globulin levels in rabbits undergoing immunization.","year":"1952"},

Growth curves showed that each cycle was composed of (a) an initial lag phase when little or no virus was released from the cells, (6) a phase of viral production, and (c) a plateau which represented a decrement in the rate of viral production. This pattern of viral multiplication occurred in monkey testicular tissue cultures which have as the liquid phase either ox serum ultrafiltrate or monkey serum-chicken embryonic extract medium. The presence of a solid medium composed of chicken plasma, clotted either with chicken embryonic extract or bovine thrombin, did not alter the pattern of viral multiplication. The shape of the growth curve as established by any of four different techniques for tissue cultivation, was shown to be independent of the cultural technique employed. For cultures of monkey testicular tissue, the amount of virus in the tissue was as much as tenfold greater than that in the liquid of the same cultures. Moreover, viral production was evident earlier and was detectable for a longer period of time in the tissue than in the liquid phase. The rapidly incremental phase of the growth cycle, when large quantities of virus were released into the liquid phase, coincided in time with the destruction of the spindle-shaped cells, which extended from the explants.

{"abstractText":"At pH 7 the bacteriophages T1 and T2 attach to anionic exchangers when suspended either in distilled water or in salt solutions. They attach to cationic exchangers only in the presence of salt. T2 requires approximately ten times higher a salt concentration than does T1 virus, a relationship which is duplicated in the attachment of these phages to their common host cell, E. coli B. The host cell, E. coli B, attaches to anionic exchangers when suspended either in salt or distilled water, but does not attach to cationic exchangers even in 0.2 M NaCl. These observations support the hypothesis previously advanced that the role of cations in effecting union of viruses to their host cells is to neutralize the repulsive electrostatic potential due to the excess of negative charges on the surfaces of both bodies. Influenza virus similarly requires salt for attachment to cationic exchangers, and unites to anionic exchangers even in the absence of salt. It is therefore proposed that the same general principles which govern the behavior of the bacteriophage system, may also apply to host cell attachment of at least some mammalian viruses. T1 bacteriophage and influenza virus are readily eluted from cationic exchangers. T2 bacteriophage cannot be recovered in active form. Experiments with P(32)- and S(35)-labelled T2 bacteriophage reveal that shortly after its attachment to the resin, the virus is split into its phosphorus-containing DNA, and the sulfur-containing protein fraction. It is proposed that the splitting of phage into its protein and DNA components that occurs ordinarily at the surface of a cell is a result of the establishment of the primary electrostatic bonds, just as in the attachment to cationic exchange resins. The affinity of cationic resins for influenza virus is great enough to remove the virus almost completely from red cells to which it has become attached.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Resins, Synthetic","Viruses"],"pmid":"13069638","title":"Virus and cell interaction with ion exchangers.","year":"1953"},
{"abstractText":"The capacity of rabbit anti-egg albumin sera to sensitize human skin has been studied. It has been shown that passive transfer by these sera is completely unrelated to the egg albumin-anti-egg albumin system, as demonstrated by a failure of passive transfer by some antisera containing ample anti-egg albumin and persistence of passive transfer in other antisera from which all anti-egg albumin had been removed by precipitation with homologous antigen. Three preparations of non-precipitating anti-egg albumin have been shown to have sensitizing capacities which bear no relation to their non-precipitating anti-egg albumin contents. From a portion of one of these the non-precipitating anti-egg albumin was removed without impairing its sensitizing ability, while in another portion obliteration of the sensitizing capacity was accomplished without reducing the anti-egg albumin. Evidence is presented to show that there are at least two possible antibodies in anti-egg albumin sera which are capable of inducing skin sensitivity and that they are antibodies against egg white impurities in crystalline egg albumin other than anti-conalbumin, anti-ovomucoid, and anti-lysozyme. The usefulness of a suitable quantitative precipitin technic for the analysis for antibodies against antigen impurities and for their selective absorption from sera is illustrated. The principle governing the procedure is described. The technic allows for the determination of a given trace antibody by working with such small concentrations of its purified specific antigen that whatever other antigen-antibody compounds are formed simultaneously with that to be determined will be below their solubility levels and consequently will not contribute appreciably to the precipitate.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Antibodies","Antigens","Immune Sera","Skin"],"pmid":"13069639","title":"Studies on the antibodies in rabbit antisera responsible for sensitization of human skin.

{"abstractText":"Equal mixtures of influenza A (PR8) and B (Lee) viruses, based on predetermined ID(50) values of the individual preparations, were titrated in closely spaced steps near the 50 per cent infectivity end-point. Typing of the hemagglutinins found in the allantoic fluids after incubation of the eggs for 72 hours showed an approximately equal distribution between types A and B, when less than 2 ID(50) of the mixed seed had been injected. With larger inocula influenza A became dominant because it reproduces at a faster rate than the influenza B virus. While this result agreed with expectations, it was found that passage of the allantoic fluids revealing influenza A agglutinins in mixture with anti-A serum, and of B agglutinins with anti-B, yielded the heterologous virus in many instances, even when only one-half of an ID(50) of mixed seed had been administered in the original titration. \"Negative\" fluids obtained from embryos injected with as little as one-eighth of an ID(50) upon passage yielded on occasion virus of one or the other type. Similar closely spaced titrations near the 50 per cent end-point of single strains (PR8) indicated that if hemagglutinins were found after incubation of 72 hours they were of high titer, as a rule. However, in some embryos hemagglutinins became detectable only between the 3rd and 4th days of incubation. In addition, negative allantoic fluids removed from embryos 72 hours after injection yielded on occasion virus on passage, yet no hemagglutinins were found in some of these eggs after an additional incubation period of 24 hours, or a total of 96 hours. None of the possible explanations for these various observations, which have been discussed in detail, is completely satisfactory. However, the data indicate that in infectivity titrations the ID(50) end-point obtained at 72 hours, or even after 96 hours, does not reflect the total amount of virus present in the material titrated.

{"abstractText":"Double infection of the allantoic sac with Melbourne and WSN viruses induced the formation of a combination virus, which had some of the antigenic properties of both parents and which maintained itself through serial passage in the chorioallantoic sac. In the course of prolonged passage in the egg, three varieties of combination virus were found. The first (X(1)) occurred in ten passages and was characterized as follows: X(1) was produced in and could be successfully passed from those chick embryos that had received very large inocula of virus. The X(1) hemagglutinin was efficiently inhibited by both M and W antisera. Each passage fluid, containing X(1) as the predominant strain, also contained large amounts of the parent forms M and W. It is very likely that X(1) reverted to parent types of virus at a high rate. The second variety (X(2)) arose from the passage series of X(1) and was carried for approximately 20 passages without definite alteration in its character. It differed from X(1) in that it had the ability to appear as the predominant form occasionally in embryos that had received a limiting infective dilution of virus. Because of this, it seems probable that X(2) reverted to parent types at a slower rate than X(1). Like X(1), this virus was never obtained in pure form and suspensions in which it predominated contained large amounts of M and W, especially the former. Good evidence was obtained that X(2) reverted to M and W virus while multiplying in the chorioallantoic sac. X(3) was derived from passage of X(2) virus after 32 transfers and can be characterized in several ways: (a) X(3) yielded the only X(3) fluids on passage in eggs. This was in striking contrast to X(2) which could not be passed without giving rise to some fluids in which M and W predominated, (b) The X(3) hemagglutinin was weakly inhibited by all but the highest concentrations of M serum, but was strongly inhibited by W serum. X(2) was readily inhibited by relatively small amounts of both sera. (c) X(3) virus, after several passages at limiting dilutions, was neutralized to a highly significant degree by specific M and W sera. This is not necessarily an essential difference from the behavior of X(2) since technical difficulties (large amounts of M and W in X(2) fluids) may have prevented the demonstration of equally striking double neutralization of this virus, (d) After five limiting dilution passages, the X(3) virus retained the characteristics listed under (a) to (c).

Profibrinolysin activation by these agents, as opposed to activation by streptokinase, seems to require the intervention of a kinase system (serofibrinokinase) inactivated by fractionation of serum and by heating to 56 degrees C. Whenever serum was submitted to treatments which caused fractionation, fixation or inhibition of complement, serofibrinokinase was also inactivated. Under the conditions investigated the behavior of this kinase was indistinguishable from that of complement.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Enzyme Precursors"],"pmid":"13096655","title":"Activation of profibrinolysin by antigen-antibody reaction and by anaphylactoid agents; its relation to complement.","year":"1953"},

{"abstractText":"Intravenous injection into rabbits of bacterial endotoxins results in an inhibition of migration of leucocytes from the buffy coat of their blood in tissue culture or in \"slide cell\" preparations. This effect was demonstrable 5 minutes after the intravenous injection and persisted for from 6 to 12 hours after the injection. It is as marked in rabbits receiving only a single intravenous injection of endotoxin as in those previously prepared intradermally and developing a severe local Shwartzman reaction on intravenous injection. The preparation of the skin for the Shwartzman reaction does not in itself result in appreciable changes of leucocyte migration. The production of the effect depends upon some action in vivo, since leucocytes of uninjected rabbits migrate normally from the buffy coat in plasma substrates to which large concentrations of endotoxin are added in vitro. The inhibitory effect, as observed in these experiments, also depends upon the added influence of centrifugation. Leucocytes from a rabbit receiving endotoxin intravenously migrate normally from uncentrifuged lung or spleen fragments and migrate normally in blood on the warm stage prior to centrifugation. Identical centrifugation does not affect leucocytes from uninjected animals. The heparin inhibition of the local Shwartzman reaction does not alter this effect of endotoxins on leucocytes.

{"abstractText":"Bacterial endotoxin injected intravenously into rabbits inhibited the migration of leucocytes from the buffy coat of centrifuged blood (4). Repeated daily injections of endotoxin resulted in the rabbits becoming resistant to the fever-inducing action of the toxin, and migration of leucocytes from centrifuged blood was no longer inhibited by injection of the toxin. Leucocyte migration from the buffy coat of centrifuged blood after injection of toxin into the rabbits appeared gradually over the first few days of repeated injections, and disappeared during the 10 to 15 days after cessation of daily injections of toxin. The resistance to endotoxin, demonstrated by leucocyte migration and pyrogen tolerance, could not be passively transferred with serum from resistant animals, and was non-specific, in that resistance to one endotoxin conferred some resistance to toxin from an organism of a different species. No relationship could be demonstrated between precipitin titer and resistance. Thorotrast abolished resistance to the fever-inducing activity of endotoxin, but its effect on leucocyte resistance was not clear, since when injected alone it inhibited migration of leucocytes from the buffy coat of centrifuged blood. The suggestion is made that the failure of toxin to inhibit the migration of leucocytes from resistant rabbits is due either to the presence of leucocytes which have become adapted to the toxin by repeated exposure, or to rapid removal of the toxin by the reticulo-endothelial system. It is unlikely that leucocyte resistance participates in the development of tolerance to the fever-inducing action of endotoxin. However, in view of the participation of the leucocyte in the pathogenesis of the Shwartzman reaction, the presence of leucocytes resistant to endotoxin may be responsible in part for the development of resistance to the Shwartzman phenomenon.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Bacteria","Leukocytes"],"pmid":"13096660","title":"Studies of the effect bacterial endotoxins on rabbit leucocytes.

The minimal amount of DNA necessary for transformation appeared to be of the same order of magnitude as the amount of DNA in a single cell. Quantitative study has been made of the resistance of transforming activity to various agents. When subjected to heat, the temperature at which the activity starts to decrease corresponds rather closely to the temperature at which the viscosity of the bulk of the DNA preparations starts to decrease. Similar correspondence was found when the transforming principle was subjected to pH changes. This is further evidence that the behavior of the active molecules is similar to the behavior of the average DNA molecule of the preparation. The activity is reduced by exposure to low ionic strength and by dehydration.

The amount of the sulfur-35 retained by the embryos was directly related to their degree of development in utero. A large fraction of the sulfur-35 found in the embryos was insoluble in 5 per cent trichloroacetic acid. At the 9th to 10th day of development, about 40 per cent of the sulfur-35 was present in this fraction. In 20-day-old embryos this fraction accounted for nearly 90 per cent of the total.

All other tissues gave much weaker autographic reactions, comparable with the over-all reaction obtained when sections from embryos fixed in a solution of formaldehyde saturated with barium hydroxide were used. By analysis for the sulfur-35 content of individual tissues the concentration of the sulfur-35 in humeri from 20-day-old embryos was found to be about 30 times that in the maternal sternum. The concentration of the isotope in the skeletal muscle, brain, heart, and skin of the same embryos was also higher than in the corresponding maternal tissues.

{"abstractText":"A method has been worked out for the measurement of the volume of sweat produced by individual glands. A special paper, impregnated with iodine, absorbs water in a uniform way and shows the area of wetting by a sharply defined blue dot. Indirect calibrations showed that 1 cm.(3) of water would form a spot of 700 cm.(2) area, and that this relation of volume to area was a constant one over a wide range. The actual volumes encountered in prints of the sweat glands were from 5 x 10(-9) to 4 x 10(-6) cm.(3). The relative activity of glands at any instant of time can be expressed by the statistical distribution of log diameter of the dots on the print. This distribution, which might at first sight seem rather artificial, has the advantage of being unaffected by a proportionate change in the output of water from each gland. Thus it is independent of the duration of contact between print paper and skin, and of changes in the average flow from the field as a whole. It is sensitive only to changes in the activity of glands relative to each other. The methods of printing and statistical analysis were used to study the relative activity of glands in a field of 22 mm. diameter. Glands of the forearm and back were studied both under direct stimulation with mecholyl and under the reflex stimulation of environmental heat, similar results being obtained with the two kinds of stimuli. Glands of the abdomen and leg, stimulated with mecholyl, were studied in one experiment. Detailed comparison of the dots in consecutive prints showed that the large dots remained large and the small dots continued to be small. These persistent differences in the outflow of water from adjacent glands were interpreted as being due to differences in the functional power of the glands. Repeated prints of the glands during a period of 75 minutes, in which the sweat flow was declining, showed that the relative activity of the glands remained constant. This meant that the set of glands, although differing greatly in power, varied together as a functional unit. Different regions of the body show not only the variation of glandular power within each small area, but also marked differences in the average power of glands belonging to the different regions. Glands of the back, for instance, show a much greater outflow than glands of the forearm when stimulated equally with a local injection of mecholyl. Equal rates of outflow, therefore, do not mean equal states of functional activity, unless the regions being compared are of equal functional power.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Sweat Glands"],"pmid":"13069656","title":"Variation in the functional power of human sweat glands.","year":"1953"},
{"abstractText":"A study has been made of the fate of staphylococci and tubercle bacilli resuspended in aqueous media at slightly acid reactions. The tests were carried out at several acid reactions in balanced ionic media containing 0.5 per cent serum albumin. These experimental conditions were selected in order to approximate those which are probably encountered by pathogenic agents in inflammatory areas and in the intracellular environment of the leucocytes after phagocytosis. The viability of the microorganisms at a given pH was markedly influenced by the composition of the medium, being decreased by addition to the latter of lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids, and increased by the addition of certain ketone bodies such as dihydroxyacetone and pyruvic, beta-hydroxybutyric, alpha-ketoglutaric, and oxalacetic acids. The presence of ketone bodies in the medium afforded to the microorganisms some protection against the bactericidal effect of lactic and acetic acids at acid reactions. The minimum and the optimum pH for growth were found to be dependent on the composition of the medium. Both were higher in the presence of lactic, acetic, propionic, and butyric acids than in the media without organic acids added. In contrast, the addition of ketone bodies to the medium allowed microbial multiplication even in acid media (approximately at pH 5.3 or even lower).

It is suggested as a working hypothesis that the process of maturation of a virus particle takes place as follows. In the earliest form the developmental bodies appear as hollow spheres, imbedded in a very dense cytoplasmic mass constituting an inclusion body, or in a less dense matrix near the nucleus in cells without typical inclusion bodies. The spheres become filled with a homogeneous material of low electron density. A small, dense granule appears in each developmental body and grows in size at the expense of the low density material.

{"abstractText":"An analysis of the growth curve obtained in vitro for influenza virus in chorioallantoic membrane has been made using two known viral inhibitors, methoxinine and alpha-amino-alpha p-methoxyphenylmethanesulfonic acid. The action of these compounds has been shown to be specific for particular phases of viral development. Further, this action is sequential indicating that the inhibited phases do not occur concurrently. The sulfonic acid interferes with the initiation of infection and with the release of newly formed virus from the host-cell. The former effect is dependent upon the relative concentrations of viral inoculum and sulfonic acid. The latter effect is prevented by the action of the receptor-destroying enzyme obtained from cholera vibrio extracts. It is proposed that a function of the viral enzyme is to facilitate the release of virus from the host-cell. The intracellular concentration of virus necessary to initiate this release is increased in the presence of alpha-amino-alpha p-methoxyphenylmethanesulfonic acid. It was found that infection can be initiated in the presence of methoxinine under which condition viral increase is disallowed. The function in viral development of one biochemical process which is inhibited by methoxinine was found to be completed at an interval after initiation of infection and before the appearance of the infectious form of the virus.

{"abstractText":"The virus-induced leakage of host-cell constituents represents a true increase in cellular permeability rather than an unpeeling of cell surface components, since an intracellular enzyme participates in the leakage. All of the T-system bacteriophages exhibit this leakage. The leakage does not occur with salt concentrations which permit only reversible virus-cell attachment but no penetration. These facts support the idea that the reaction underlying cell leakage is a part of the invasive mechanism. With increasing multiplicity of T2 infection of young, fresh Escherichia coli B cells, progressively larger molecules leak out of the cell. Acid-soluble P(32) appears in large amounts with single infection. Appreciable amounts of galactosidase enzyme and RNA do not leak until multiplicities of 5 to 30 are attained. Cellular DNA is not liberated unless sufficiently high multiplicities are used to cause the extensive cell destruction and clearing of the suspension characteristic of lysis-from-without. This progression is interpreted as an increase with T2 multiplicity in the maximum hole size produced in the cell membrane. Calculation shows that this increase in hole size must result from a spreading change in the character of the cell wall, rather than the coincidental juxtaposition of 2 or more viruses at adjacent attachment sites. T1 virus liberates less macromolecular constituents than T2 from E. coli B. The following experimental results constitute evidence that in the course of normal virus infection, a resealing reaction is rapidly instituted in the cell wall which reverses the effect of the original permeability increase, and renders the cell refractory to a second lytic reaction by a homologous virus: (a) Cell leakage induced by T2 virus in the course of normal infection markedly slows down or stops within a few minutes, even when only a small fraction of the material potentially available for leakage has been released, (b) Superinfection after 8 minutes at 37 degrees C., of a cell previously infected with a homologous virus causes little or no appearance of a second leakage of cell constituents. This experiment also leads to the conclusion that the sealing reaction, like that which causes the leakage, also involves a disturbance which spreads over all or most of the cell wall. (c) If a multiple virus infection is allowed to occur at 0 degrees C. and then the cells are placed in a 37 degrees C. bath after completion of attachment, a much greater cell leakage results than if the entire course had occurred at 37 degrees C., as would be expected if a resealing reaction comes into play at 37 degrees C. within a time less than that required by the completion of attachment. The virus particles attaching secondarily at 37 degrees C. are prevented from exercising their permeability-increasing effect by the sealing reaction of the virus which had penetrated first. Although a second homologous cell infection with T1 or T2 phages after a 37 degrees C. incubation fails to yield a second leakage, a second heterologous infection always causes exacerbation of new leakage, which, especially if T1 has preceded T2, may be much greater than the sum of those produced individually by each virus in separate cell suspensions. This phenomenon may be the action responsible for the \"depressor\" effect which occurs when 2 unrelated viruses attack the same cell. The properties of the sealing phenomenon are such as to make it appear a logical candidate for the mechanism underlying the exclusion of a superinfecting phage from participating in reproductive processes in a cell previously infected with a homologous virus, since the DNA of the second virus would be unable to penetrate the new barrier. Experiments to test this hypothesis revealed that the DNA from such superinfecting virus is completely extractable from cells by washing in dilute buffer, whereas about 40 to 50 per cent of the attached DNA of virus which has invaded virgin cells remains bound to the cells. Most of the viral DNA which appears in the original supernatant when P(32)-labelled T2 invades E. coli B in a multiplicity less than one, does not represent inert material but rather virus DNA which has been split, or split and hydrolyzed as a result of its interaction with the cells, as judged by the altered susceptibility to hydrolytic enzyme or to TCA precipitation. This suggests that 25 per cent or more of the virus DNA may be expendable, at least after the penetration stage of the infection cycle. Mg(++) which strongly depresses the amount of cell leakage attending T2 infection, does not prevent T2 penetration nor does it block the appearance of the exclusion reaction. Hence, if the initial leakage does mirror the lytic process by which a hole for the DNA injection is provided, the Mg(++) does not function by preventing this hole formation. Its effect would have to lie in prevention of the spreading lysis-potentiating reaction or in augmenting the sealing mechanism. A large number of independent lines of evidence indicate that the phenomenon of lysis-from-without exhibited by the T-even coliphages is the result of failure of the sealing mechanism to keep pace with the lytic reaction. This can result from an excess of infecting phages or inhibition of the cellular energy-liberating reaction required by the sealing mechanism. The complete parallelism between the development of refractoriness to lysis-from-without and development of refractoriness to the production of a new leakage from a homologous superinfection is especially convincing in this connection. It is proposed that the early phase of bacteriophage invasion involves the following steps: reversible electrostatic attachment; splitting of the viral DNA from its protein coat; initiation of a lytic reaction in the cell wall at the site of virus attachment; injection of the DNA through the hole so produced; a spreading disturbance over the cell surface which makes it momentarily more susceptible to the lytic reaction; sealing of the hole and a concommittant spread over the cell wall of a reaction making the cell refractory to initiation of a second lytic reaction. Na(+), K(+), and Mg(++) all behave differently in their effect on the leakage produced in the course of T2 invasion of E. coli.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Bacteriophages","Escherichia coli"],"pmid":"13233443","title":"Mechanism of cell wall penetration by viruses.

The extracts from leucocytes of non-irradiated animals were thermolabile, non-dialyzable, had a pH optimum of 7.5, and were capable of being precipitated by NH(4)SO(4) and of calcium phosphate fractionation. The observed increase in susceptibility of irradiated rats to infection with M. aureus was correlated not only with granulopenia but also with the alteration of the above indicated functions of the granulocytes of the irradiated animals.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Leukocytes","Phagocytosis","Radiation Effects"],"pmid":"13233452","title":"The effect of ionizing radiation on phagocytosis and the bactericidal power of the blood.

{"abstractText":"Tubercle bacilli separated from young cultures were thoroughly extracted with monochlorobenzene at temperatures never exceeding 50 degrees C. From the soluble material, a fraction corresponding to approximately 1 per cent of the total bacillary weight was separated by fractional precipitation with petrolic ether at temperatures of 0 degrees or 4 degrees C.-depending upon the strain of bacilli. The monochlorobenzene-soluble-ether-insoluble material (fraction 7) prepared from BCG-P was found to contain 0.14 per cent nitrogen and 0.4 per cent phosphorus. Some of its other chemical characteristics are described. Fraction 7 proved unable to elicit tuberculin allergy in guinea pigs, but injection of 5 microg. of it into the skin produced severe local reactions. In albino mice, a single intraperitoneal injection of 20 microg. caused loss of muscular tone and of weight followed by death within 9 days. The only tissue reaction observed was a slight degree of peritonitis. In mice of the C57 BL strain, a single injection of 40 microg. also caused death in the same time, but with pulmonary hemorrhages-usually massive. Material similar to fraction 7 was obtained from one virulent, two attenuated, and one avirulent strain of mammalian tubercle bacilli (bovine and human). The fractions obtained from the various strains differed somewhat in solubility and toxicity. The more virulent the culture, the more toxic was the fraction obtained from it; but it is possible that this relation was the result of differences in the effectiveness of the extraction procedures, rather than of characteristics inherent to the cultures. Evidence is presented that the toxicity of fraction 7 accounts for much of the primary toxicity of tubercle bacilli.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Mycobacterium tuberculosis"],"pmid":"13233453","title":"A fraction of tubercle bacilli possessing primary toxicity.","year":"1955"},
{"abstractText":"It proved possible to increase the resistance of mice to tuberculous infection by vaccinating them with a suspension of avirulent tubercle bacilli killed by exposure to 2 per cent phenol. This increase in resistance was demonstrated by two different techniques: (a) observation of survival time of vaccinated animals following challenge infection with a large dose of virulent bacilli, and (b) determination of numbers of virulent bacilli in the spleens of animals 2 weeks after injection of a small infective dose. The minimum protective dose of vaccine corresponded to approximately one-tenth the acutely toxic dose. Addition of an adjuvant to the bacillary suspension markedly increased both the protective effectiveness of the vaccine and the duration of the immunity. It enhanced also the toxicity of the vaccine in approximately the same proportion. However, other lines of evidence suggested that toxicity and protective activity were independent one from the other and were the manifestations of different bacillary constituents. Extraction with absolute methanol released from the bacillary bodies a crude soluble fraction possessing low, if any, toxicity, yet capable of eliciting in mice a state of increased resistance to virulent infection.

{"abstractText":"An analysis has been made of factors contributing to the von Magnus phenomenon; i.e., the emergence of increasing quantities of non-infectious hemagglutinins (NIHA) in successive passages in the allantois of chick embryos of undiluted allantoic fluids infected with influenza virus. Using the PR8 strain, the von Magnus phenomenon was pronounced when the serial seeds were obtained under conditions which permitted extensive inactivation of infectious virus during individual passages. Correspondingly, it was reduced but not abolished when precautions were taken to avoid accumulation of inactivated virus in the inocula. Thus, inactivated virus may be taken as a contributing factor. Preparations of infectious virus obtained under conditions largely excluding the presence of inactivated virus were capable of yielding some NIHA on passage as long as sufficient amounts were injected to permit each host cell to adsorb several infectious virus particles. However, the fact remains that more NIHA was found in the harvests when the inocula contained a large proportion of non-infectious virus material. Following injection of various types of seeds NIHA appeared in the allantoic fluids as soon as liberation of virus became detectable. This time relationship and the rates of release of non-infectious virus components seemed to exclude that the NIHA obtained consisted entirely of infectious virus which had been inactivated during incubation in ovo. It was apparent rather that NIHA other than that due to heat-inactivated virus was released. Correlations between the infectivities and hemagglutinating capacities of over 50 standard and undiluted passage seeds and the compositions of the harvests derived therefrom on passage without dilution indicated that the corresponding activities in the yields did not depend entirely upon the relative concentrations of infectious virus and non-infectious hemagglutinins in the inocula but that apparently different forms of NIHA were obtained in successive undiluted passages.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"14367672","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system.

{"abstractText":"The role of inactivated influenza virus in the von Magnus phenomenon has been studied by exposing standard virus preparations in vitro to 37 degrees C. for periods up to 6 or more days. The rate of inactivation of the infectious property of the line of PR8 virus employed was found to be approximately 1.1 log(10) unit per day, denoting a half-life of 6(1\/2) hours. The rate of inactivation was similar in the allantoic cavity of chick embryos. On allantoic passage of such heated seeds without dilution it was seen that with a decrease in the infectivity of the inocula proportionately less infectious virus was found in the harvests. The yields of hemagglutinins were much less affected, and thus ID(50)\/HA ratios of as low as 10(1.0) were observed in the 24 hour harvests. The ratios of the yields always equalled or were higher than those of the inocula. On 100- or 1000-fold dilution of the heated seeds standard virus was obtained. Growth curves in intact chick embryos or in deembryonated eggs (differential yields) revealed that non-infectious hemagglutinins appeared in the tissues or were liberated therefrom as soon as any virus activity became detectable. Furthermore, once maximal liberation had been established, infectious virus and non-infectious hemagglutinins were released for extended periods of time at nearly constant rates and in unchanging proportions, the latter depending upon the seed employed. Heated standard virus and undiluted passage seeds (von Magnus), selected on the basis of similar ID(50) and HA concentrations, failed to yield similar results in differential growth curves in deembryonated eggs. Although the hemagglutinin titers in the 2-hourly harvests were nearly identical, the undiluted passage seeds produced as little as 1 per cent of the infectious virus which was derived from the heated inocula. Thus considerable differences exist between the 2 types of seeds.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"14367673","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system.

{"abstractText":"An experimental analysis is here presented of the conditions that lead to the appearance of non-infectious hemagglutinins (NIHA) in the allantoic fluid of chick embryos injected with standard influenza virus (PR8 strain) which had been exposed to 37 degrees C. in vitro for various periods of time. On progressive reduction of the infectivity of the undiluted inocula from about 10(9) to 10(3) ID(50) (10(3.2) HA units) the yields of infectious virus in 24 hours decreased in straight correspondence 1 millionfold, but those of hemagglutinins only by a factor of 10. Thus the proportions of NIHA in the yields increased sharply but the total quantity obtained decreased gradually. The quantities of infectious virus produced per ID(50) injected were the same throughout this range; i.e., between 50 and 100 ID(50), regardless of increasing proportions of heat-inactivated virus in the seeds. This value agrees with previous estimates of yields under other conditions. Thus, initiation and completion of first cycles by the infectious virus remaining in the inocula were not, or at most, slightly inhibited. The inactivated virus, therefore, failed to establish immediate interference. It was capable, however, of holding the infectious process to one cycle. Upon 10-fold dilution of the seeds essentially similar results were obtained except that a slight loss in interfering activity could now be detected with an increase in exposure to 37 degrees C. With further dilutions little or no interference was noted. The capacity to yield NIHA decreased slowly during exposure of the seeds to 37 degrees C. over a period of 5 days, thereafter more rapidly. It could not be restored by addition of infectious virus. Furthermore, since NIHA was obtained when the seeds contained as little as 10(2) or 10(3) ID(50), it is unlikely that it was derived from those cells which had adsorbed both infectious and inactivated seed virus. It is suggestive that multiple adsorption of inactivated virus particles per se will yield NIHA. The available information, as discussed, favors the view that the NIHA does not represent seed virus in some form but is newly produced.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"14367674","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system.

{"abstractText":"Using a highly concentrated and partially purified streptolysin O preparation, migrating agar precipitins have been found in 94 of 143 human sera from patients with a variety of diseases. Most of those showing no bands, had very low antistreptolysin titers. A correlation was found between the migration rates of these bands and the antistreptolysin titer. A strong trend toward a straight line relationship was apparent when the ASO titers were plotted on a logarithmic scale. In addition, a roughly positive correlation was found between the intensity of these bands and the antistreptolysin O titers. The finding of high levels of antistreptolysin O activity and slowly migrating heavy bands in normal pooled human gamma globulin supported the above observations. Very similar results were obtained with rabbit and guinea pig sera after immunization with the streptolysin O concentrates. The data strongly indicate that antistreptolysin O activity in human sera is generally due to precipitating antibody, and that non-specific inhibitors are not usually involved, even with low titered sera. Rabbit and guinea pig antisera to the oxidized inactive and to the reduced active forms of streptolysin O showed no obvious differences.

These antigens were prepared from a Group A hemolytic streptococcus (strain C203S). Strong evidence was presented suggesting that some of the bands seen with streptolysin O concentrate represented antibody reponses to streptococcal antigens heretofore undescribed. Tests were also carried out with other streptococcal antigens, including streptokinase-desoxyribonuclease mixture from Group C streptococci (varidase-Lederle), crystalline proteinase, proteinase precursor, C carbohydrate, and sonic vibrated streptococcal cell extracts (group A, C203S). Fewer bands were seen with these preparations, and with some they were quite uncommon. The observations indicated that the predominating antibody responses in human streptococcal infections were to extracellular products of the micro-organisms, and only very slightly and infrequently to intracellular antigens. The human sera studied included sera from patients with active or convalescent rheumatic fever, and non-rheumatic subjects suffering from a variety of illnesses. As was expected, the rheumatic subjects showed antibody responses to many more of the antigens present in these preparations than did the nonrheumatic group. Pooled normal human gamma globulin was found to contain many of the antibodies found in potent human sera. This finding confirmed the antigen-antibody nature of the bands seen with individual sera. The epidemiological significance of these findings with gamma, globulin was briefly discussed. It was found that rabbit, guinea pig, and human antibody precipitin bands join quite readily in the Ouchterlony tests. This finding adds another tool for the identification of the precipitin bands found with human sera.

{"abstractText":"Antigenically different strains of mouse-adapted PR8 influenza A virus have been produced by 17 serial passages of the virus in the lungs of mice immunized with the homologous agent. Comparative serological tests show that the variant strains share antigenic components with the parent strain but the dominant antigen is different. By means of antibody absorption it was shown that the \"new\" antigenic component of the variant was already present in minor amounts up to the eighth passage and thereafter gained prominence with continued passage in vaccinated mice. Groups of mice vaccinated with either the PR8-S or T(21) virus and having comparable antibody titers showed no growth of virus in the lungs following aid-borne challenge with homologous strains. On the other hand, following heterologous air-borne challenge no deaths occurred, but virus grew in the lungs of both groups of vaccinated mice. Almost unrestricted virus multiplication took place in the lungs of mice vaccinated with the parent strain and challenged with the PR8-T(21) virus which resulted in extensive consolidation. Less virus grew in the lungs of the mice vaccinated with the variant strains and challenged with the PR8-S virus. In these animals only microscopic evidence of changes due to virus growth in the lungs was observed. The successful serial passage of PR8 influenza A virus in immunized animals was dependent on the initial selection of mice with uniformly low H.I. antibody titers as determined on tail blood, and the intranasal instillation of sufficient virus to favor the survival of those virus particles least related to the antibodies present.

When excessive amounts of toxin were used for preparation the incidence of the reaction was reduced. Animals undergoing the generalized Shwartzman reaction became severely prostrated within several hours after the provoking injection of toxin. The renal lesion became fully developed within 24 hours, and its occurrence was associated with a rise of the blood non-protein nitrogen. Edema and petechial hemorrhages in the ears were observed in rabbits with advanced renal lesions. The earliest change in the kidneys in the generalized Shwartzman reaction was the appearance of homogeneous, eosinophilic material, resembling fibrinoid, within the lumen of the glomerular capillaries. Occlusion of the capillaries by this material was regarded as the cause of subsequent tubular necrosis in the renal cortex. The material appeared to be derived from the blood, rather than from the capillary walls. Cortisone enhanced the lethal effect of a single, large dose of meningococcal toxin, as well as causing bilateral renal cortical necrosis. The generalized Shwartzman reaction produced by two injections of toxin was aggravated by cortisone and ACTH. Profound polymorphonuclear leukopenia was produced by both the preparing and provoking injections of toxin. When leukopenia was produced before the preparing injection of toxin, by treatment with nitrogen mustard, the generalized Shwartzman reaction was inhibited. During the intervals before and after leukopenia, and when leukopenia was prevented by shielding the femoral bone marrow from the action of nitrogen mustard, no inhibition of the generalized Shwartzman phenomenon was demonstrable. Various colloidal and particulate materials, which are capable of provoking the local skin Shwartzman reaction when injected intravenously, failed to provoke the generalized Shwartzman reaction. A working hypothesis was set up to account for certain events in the generalized Shwartzman reaction.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Hypersensitivity"],"pmid":"13022854","title":"Studies on the generalized Shwartzman reaction:  I.

{"abstractText":"Specific staining with fluorescein-labelled immune serum was used to study the progress of mumps virus infection in a series of embryos harvested at daily intervals. The results were compared with the hemagglutinin and infectivity titers of the corresponding extraembryonic fluids. The evidence obtained indicated that the multiplication of the virus was restricted to those cells which came into surface contact with infected fluid. Following intraamniotic inoculation into 8 day old embryos, these included the cells lining the amniotic membrane and the epidermal and pharyngeal epithelium. Depending apparently on the extent of the contamination of the allantoic cavity and of the extraembryonic celom in the course of inoculation, varying amounts of virus were also present in the cells lining the chorioallantoic membrane and occasionally in the peritoneum. During the later stages of the infection, staining which was principally if not entirely extracellular was seen in the gastrointestinal tract, and, after the dissolution of the tracheal plug, in the respiratory tract. The virus was first detected 1 to 2 days after inoculation as brightly fluorescent intracytoplasmic granules of varying size. As these granules increased in size and number they gradually filled the cytoplasm of the outer one or two layers of cells lining the adjoining cavity. The extent and brightness of the staining reached a peak 4 to 6 days after inoculation and thereafter decreased progressively. The staining of the tissues closely paralleled the rise and fall in the infectivity of the extraembryonic fluids. The development of hemagglutinins, on the other hand, provided a less sensitive measure of virus multiplication than did the staining. No differences were detected in the mortality of the infected and control series of embryos nor was there evidence of any pathological changes. In contrast to the 8 day old embryos, no virus multiplication was detected following the inoculation of 16 day old embryos.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Mumps"],"pmid":"13022857","title":"Fate of mumps virus in the embryonated egg as determined by specific staining with fluorescein-labelled immune serum.","year":"1952"},

{"abstractText":"A detailed study of the cytological changes which are induced in HeLa cells by the Saukett strain of Type III poliomyelitis virus has been made. The observations were of cultures in which a single sequence of infection was induced. The cytological changes were examined in relation to the growth curve of the virus in the same type of culture. This curve showed a latent period of 4 to 5 hours, followed by a gradual release of virus over an interval of 6 to 7 hours. Changes in the staining character of the cells occurred before the major portion of the viral yield appeared. The infected cells exhibited a striking cytopathology with increased basophilia, nuclear pyknosis, and basophilic cytoplasmic granules. Individual cells showed characteristic differences in the rate at which the cytopathology progresses. The multiplication of the virus in HeLa cells was inhibited by fluorophenylalanine. The inhibitory effectiveness of the antimetabolite was related to the age of the infection. It apparently inhibits only an early stage of viral development. The inhibition is completely reversed by phenylalanine if the amino acid is added within 6 hours, not later, after the induction of virostasis. The data are interpreted in terms of the rate at which the ability of the infected cell to support viral synthesis was lost. Flurophenylalanine also inhibited the multiplication of HeLa cells; however, the effect upon the uninfected cell was reversible after 3 days, as indicated by viability after such treatment. While the fluoro derivative completely inhibited viral multiplication, it did not prevent the cytopathogenic effect of the virus. In the presence of fluorophenylalanine, the disintegration of an infected cell proceeded at what appeared to be the ordinary rate, without any increase of the infectious agent. Experimentally the processes leading to viral increase and to cellular injury have been shown to possess a significant degree of autonomy.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Poliovirus"],"pmid":"13211906","title":"Growth characteristics of poliomyelitis virus in HeLa cell cultures; lack of parallelism in cellular injury and virus increase.","year":"1954"},

However, skin-sensitizing antitoxic sera were distinguished by a relatively large beta globulin component and a small or indistinct alpha(2) globulin. Fusion of both components was present in some sera containing this variety of antitoxin. Considerable amounts of serum-bound polysaccharides in these sera migrated relatively slowly in contrast to the behavior of polysaccharides of precipitating antitoxic sera which migrated faster when tested under similar conditions. Alterations in proteins and carbohydrates were most readily observed in specimens containing high titers of antitoxin. There were no demonstrable differences between the electrophoretic behavior of sera obtained from subjects before or after immunization with toxoid. Electrophoretic patterns of serum from allergic subjects who developed marked eosinophilia showed attenuation of the alphas globulin associated with a relative preponderance of slow migrating protein-bound polysaccharides. These alterations were not present in sera obtained from the same persons before and after the development of eosinophilia. Changes in the proteins and polysaccharides could not be demonstrated with consistency in subjects with mild to moderate hay-fever symptoms. One person who developed severe acute hay-fever symptoms showed alterations in the beta and alpha(2) globulins.

Dependent upon the agent employed, 10(6.5) to 10(8.5) E.I.D. was essential to elicit this phenomenon. To accomplish this unusual multiplication it was essential to use a strain of virus which effected extensive pulmonary consolidation; strains of virus which did not produce marked lung lesions, even when as much as 10(8.5) E.I.D. was inoculated, did not form non-infectious virus. The development of this viral form was directly dependent upon the extent of cell damage obtained: consolidation of more than 50 per cent of the lung volume was required. The majority of non-infectious particles developed during the initial cycle of viral multiplication, and concurrently with the formation of non-infectious virus there was a corresponding decrease in the number of infectious viral particles. Non-infectious virus could not be propagated on serial passage in mouse lungs: on second lung passage only fully infectious virus was detectable. The formation of the non-infectious viral form was not the result of interference with synthesis of infectious virus by inactivated virus in the inoculum; for inoculation of heated infected allantoic fluid which contained more than 99 per cent of non-infectious virus did not result in the development of new non-infectious virus. Although inoculation of a large quantity of virus resulted in infection which yielded a relatively low titer of infectious and high titer of non-infectious virus, inoculation of a small quantity of the agent resulted in a high yield of infectious virus and no non-infectious that was detectable. In both instances the total quantity of antigenic viral material synthesized in the mouse lungs was the same.

{"abstractText":"As a preliminary to a study of the fate of mucoprotein substrate in tissues infected with influenza virus, some characteristics of soluble hemagglutination inhibitors (HI) extracted from chorioallantoic membranes (CAM) have been investigated. The inhibitory material was found to be heat-stable, precipitable with cold ethanol, and subject to progressive inactivation by active viruses or by receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE). Certain changes in the slope of titration curves obtained with precipitated and non-precipitated fractions upon alcohol fractionation suggested that the HI in heated CAM extracts was heterogeneous. Alcohol in low concentration precipitated preferentially the more efficient (longer?) HI leaving the \"weak\" component in the non-precipitated fraction. With higher concentrations of alcobol, \"strong\" HI were converted to \"weak\" ones, either by denaturation or as result of reduced solubility. These changes in slope of titration curves were reflected in significant discrepancies when densitometric titers (HI(50)) of fractions were compared with their titers in pattern tests. The action of active viruses on HI, on the other hand, did not induce qualitative changes in the composition of the inhibitory principle: Titration curves retained parallel slopes even when their position was markedly displaced from that of control curves. In its essential properties, the HI from the CAM appeared to be similar to inhibitors isolated from various other biological sources which have been identified as mucoprotein in nature. Standards for reproducibility of inhibitory titers obtained by the densitometric method of Hirst and Pickels have been presented. The relation of HI to the allantoic epithelium has been analyzed. It has been concluded that the HI is a normal constituent and secretion product of these cells. Under physiological conditions, i.e. in the intact egg, the HI contained in the mucoid outer layer of allantoic cells appears to be protected from enzymatic action from without, although adsorption of viral particles may be temporarily impeded. In deembryonated eggs, or in excised membranes, a reduction in total inhibitory substrate as a result of the action of RDE has been observed. It has been shown in experiments on adsorption of active or heat-inactivated virus on the allantoic membrane that prevention of adsorption by RDE may require the synergistic action of the active viral enzyme itself. It has been concluded that the maintenance or restoration of a normal supply of mucoprotein substrate is a function of the ability of allantoic cells to maintain homeostatic conditions under stress.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Allantois","Hemagglutination","Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"13295489","title":"Influenza virus and its mucoprotein substrate in the chorioallantoic membrane of the chick embryo.

It has been shown that a decrease in HI is demonstrable when all or nearly all cells of the allantois are involved in the infectious process. Once this condition is fulfilled, viral multiplication in the CAM is associated with stepwise breakdown and partial restoration of HI. The periodicity of these steps is in close agreement with earlier reports by others on the duration of primary and secondary cycles of viral multiplication. Periodicity of viral multiplication and of HI breakdown with subsequent restoration is particularly pronounced in eggs pretreated with metaperiodate or with mixtures of periodate and glucose or glycerol. The stepwise nature of the HI breakdown indicates that it is in some way related to intracellular phases of viral reproduction, and that individual cells produce virus in cycles rather than continuously.

Transplantable tumors have been used to provoke and to measure transplantation immunity. Cells from the lymph nodes draining a tumor homograft were transferred as mince or in suspension into the peritoneum of a secondary host to confer immunity. These cells could confer immunity while the immunizing graft was undergoing breakdown during the primary, and also during the more rapid secondary, response. Cells from other nodes and from the spleen, and also whole blood or serum failed in these experiments to transfer immunity. In one combination of tumor and host, serum from immunized donors enhanced tumor growth. Evidence has been presented favoring the hypothesis that the lymph node cells were immunologically activated before transfer, and that they conferred immunity by continuing to function in their host. Immunization by tumor cells transferred along with the cells of the nodes could not account for the failure of lymph node transferred into susceptible animals to give rise to tumors; nor for the failure of tumor cells to give rise to immunity as rapidly as transferred lymph node cells. Freezing and thawing of the transferred cells prevented transfer of immunity. Cells from donors immunized against an isoantigen failed to confer immunity on hosts which carried that isoantigen, offering evidence of absorption of antibody. The duration of immunity transferred within an inbred strain was shorter than actively induced immunity, but longer than could have been expected of passively transferred immunity. After transfer of cells into foreign hosts, immunity declined more rapidly, as if the transferred cells were destroyed by the homograft reaction of the host.

{"abstractText":"The relation between serum antibody and resistance to tumor homografts in the mouse has been investigated. Production of serum antibody in response to homografts of a transplantable sarcoma (Sarcoma 1) was demonstrated, by cytotoxic action on the cells of the tumor, and also by a hemagglutinin test. The simpler and more repeatable hemagglutinin test was further investigated. Peak hemagglutinin titres were reached after the immunizing homografts underwent breakdown. Following transfer of lymph node cells from immunized mice into hosts of the same strain, hemagglutinin could be detected in the host serum. The course of its production showed that this secondary antibody was not elicited by transferred antigen, nor could it be due to transfer of preformed antibody. The cells developed the capacity to transfer hemagglutinin production later than the power to transfer heightened graft resistance. Spleen cells also transferred hemagglutinin production, at a later stage after immunization and to a lesser extent than cells from the regional lymph nodes. Implantation of the sarcoma in mice pretreated with certain preparations of lyophilized or frozen tissue stimulated hemagglutinin production, although the tumor grew progressively. The regional lymph nodes participated in the response: they could transfer hemagglutinin production into secondary hosts, but not graft resistance, and indeed appeared to diminish resistance. Lymph node cells from immunized donors conferred protection against the tumor on pretreated mice. Lymph nodes from normal donors also appeared in some experiments to confer protection although the effect was obscured by the rapidity with which the growing tumor became immunologically invulnerable. The fate of lymph node cells stained with acriflavine was followed after transfer. No effect of the staining on the power of the cells to confer immunity could be detected. Cells transferred to the peritoneal cavity passed into various host tissues, but were not found in test homografts.

A positive correlation (r = 0.63) of high statistical significance has been demonstrated between the degree of granulation of JG cells (JGI) and the width of the zona glomerulosa in 159 rats from 5 series of experiments in which low, normal, and high salt regimens were employed. A somewhat higher correlation (r = 0.81) was obtained when only rats were included from the most recent experiment of the series in which JGI counts were more accurate. Under the conditions of these experiments, therefore, increased granulation and degranulation of JG cells were associated with hyperactivity and suppressed activity, respectively, of the zona glomerulosa. Rats sacrificed 4 to 7 weeks after hypophysectomy were found to have normal JG cells. This finding constitutes another example of the similarity in response of JG cells to that of the zona glomerulosa, which also remained unaltered following hypophysectomy despite atrophy of the rest of the adrenal cortex.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Adrenal Cortex","Kidney"],"pmid":"13242744","title":"Studies on renal juxtaglomerular cells.

It has been found that p-fluorophenylalanine is phase-specific, does not interfere with the initiation of infection but rather acts during the productive period of the infectious sequence. The site of action of this fluoroderivative has been described relative to the site of action of methoxinine. By the use of this inhibitor in combination with methoxinine, it has been possible to recognize two stages of development which were not discernible from the usual growth curve. In a multicellular culture these two reactions, A and B, occur for the most part simultaneously, during the latent and productive periods. Reaction A is inhibited by methoxinine, but not by fluorophenylalanine. It begins early in the latent period and can proceed independent of reaction B.

{"abstractText":"Influenza A and B virus reproduction in the allantoic membrane of the intact chicken embryo was studied quantitatively with particle enumeration procedures. Virus particles were enumerated on the basis of two independent properties; capacity to infect and to cause hemagglutination. The infective property of influenza B virus (Lee) was even more unstable than that of influenza A virus (PR8). Inactivation occurred at a constant logarithmic rate which was independent of the concentration of particles and corresponded with first order reaction kinetics. In allantoic fluid at 35 degrees C. either in vitro or in vivo, Lee virus had a half-life for infectivity of only 85 minutes. In contrast, the hemagglutinating property, like that of PR8, was relatively stable and was not appreciably affected by 12 hours at 35 degrees C. On the basis that the number of non-infective particles is equal to the number of hemagglutinating particles minus the number of infective particles and that the number of cells lining the allnatoic membrane is 1.8 x 10(7), the effects of various particle-cell ratios on the reproductive process were analyzed. Adsorption of infective and non-infective Lee particles occurred at the same logarithmic rate, i.e. about 50 per cent in 72 minutes, and the rate was nearly independent of the particle-cell ratio up to a value of 55. The adsorption capacity of an allantoic cell was at least 44 Lee or 89 PR8 particles. The interval before new particles appeared in the allantoic fluid increased as the particle-cell ratio was decreased with both Lee and PR8. At ratios of 0.2 or less, the appearance time for infective particles was nearly identical to that for hemagglutinating particles with both viruses. At ratios of about 1.0, the \"latent period\" in the allantoic membrane per se was computed to be 150 to 160 minutes for both Lee and PR8. The number of particles, both infective and hemagglutinating, increased at a constant logarithmic rate for 6 hours or more after the adsorptive period. With Lee virus, at a particle-cell ratio of 5 or less, the doubling time was constant and had a value of 43 minutes. The dynamics of the logarithmic increase period suggest that reproduction corresponds to an autocatalytic reaction in which the rate is proportional to the amount of material produced. When the particle-cell ratio was increased to 10 or more, either with infective or non-infective (inactivated at 35 degrees C. or 22 degrees C.) particles, the doubling time increased to 65 minutes. Comparable effects from high ratios were found with PR8. Non-infective particles accumulated at a rapid rate after the interval of constant logarithmic increase regardless of the particle-cell ratio. This accumulation was even more striking with Lee than with PR8 as was expected because of the shorter half-life of the infective property. With both viruses at particle-cell ratios of 4 or more, a large proportion of the particles were non-infective within a few hours after new particles appeared. At particle-cell ratios of 0.2 or less, the maximal yield was relatively constant, i.e., about 900 to 1400 hemagglutinating particles per cell with Lee and 500 to 900 with PR8. However, even with very low ratios, i.e. 0.001 or less, it was not possible to obtain more than about 160 infective particles per cell with either virus regardless of the interval. As was expected, the lower the ratio, the longer was the interval before maximal yields were produced. At ratios of about 10, the maximal yield was reduced by 50 per cent or more with both viruses. Comparable reductions in yield were obtained whether the high particle-cell ratio was due to infective or non-infective (inactivated at 35 degrees C. or 22 degrees C.) particles. These findings indicate that there is a critical particle-cell ratio above which alterations appear in the dynamics of reproduction of influenza viruses. This ratio has a value of approximately 3. The observed alterations in the reproductive process are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that adsorption of 3 or more infective or non-infective particles per cell induces cell damage.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"13263486","title":"Reproduction of influenza viruses; quantitative investigations with particle enumeration procedures on the dynamics of influenza A and B virus reproduction.","year":"1955"},
{"abstractText":"As evidenced by specific staining with fluorescent antibody, the major sites of multiplication of the PR8 and Lee B strains of influenza virus in chick embryos injected by the amniotic route were in the cells lining the amnion and in the epidermal and pharyngeal epithelium.

No virus was detectable in any of the other tissues of 25 embryos injected between the 7th and 11th days of incubation and examined 48 hours later. Three out of five of the embryos inoculated with the PR8 strain of influenza virus on the 12th day of incubation, on the other hand, showed in addition extensive involvement of the cells lining the respiratory tract. Specific staining of the tissues was first detectable when the ID(50) of the amniotic fluids attained a level of greater than 4.5, which corresponded to the time of the appearance of hemagglutinins.

Cytologically, the multiplication of the influenza viruses was characterized by a diffuse type of immunospecific staining which was first detectable in the nuclei and later in the cytoplasm of the cells.

Addition of beef embryo extract (BEE) to cultures at a time when virus multiplication was declining reversed this general trend and resulted in greater virus growth. This virus-stimulating action of BEE was only partially diminished by colchicine, a mitotic inhibitor, indicating that the action of BEE was not due entirely to the development of a larger population of cells as a result of its enhancement of cell proliferation. Chick embryo tissue cultivated for 13 days in BSS prior to infection lost its ability to support the growth of psittacosis virus, but this capacity could be restored by the addition of BEE, alone or with colchicine, at the time of infection. A significant amount of virus was adsorbed to tissue in BSS alone, indicating that the failure of virus to grow in depleted tissue maintained only in BSS after infection was not due entirely to failure of virus to attach to and invade the cells. It was found that an ultrafiltrate and a dialysate of BEE contained the major part of the stimulating capacity of the whole extract, indicating that the active materials were substances of low molecular weights. Autoclaved lactalbumin hydrolysate was an active stimulator, suggesting that the materials responsible for its activity were relatively heat-stable. Since a chemically defined medium (Parker 199) was equally effective in stimulating viral growth, it should be possible eventually to define the chemical nature of the virus stimulators.

{"abstractText":"Treatment of radioactively labelled host cells with T1 or T2 bacteriophages induces a leakage of cellular P and S into the medium. Evidence is presented showing that this increased cell permeability is not the result of complete lysis of a small fraction of the cells, but rather is made up of contributions from all or most of the infected population. This leakage of cellular constituents exhibits the following characteristics: (a) Infection of a cell with a single virus suffices to evoke the reaction; (b) Increasing the multiplicity up to 7 to 8 virus particles per cell does not affect the extent of leakage produced; (c) Some leakage does occur at 0 degrees C., but much less than at 37 degrees C.; (d) Infection by T1 virus results in a smaller amount of leakage than in the case of T2, but the pattern of response to varying virus multiplicity is the same; (e) The P resulting from such leakage contains no DNA and chemically resembles that which elutes in smaller amounts from uninfected cells; (f) At 37 degrees C. the virus-induced leakage reaction appears within a matter of seconds, and usually decreases after 2 to 3 minutes; (g) The reaction is inhibited by 0.025 M Mg(++). Theoretical considerations are presented suggesting the place of this reaction in the sequence of events constituting the virus penetration reaction; its relationship to the phenomenon of lysis-from-without; and its resemblance to the leakage reaction produced by electrostatic binding of ionized compounds to cell surfaces.

The evidence suggests that this small proportion, \"the susceptible cells\" possess a property or substance needed by the DNA in order to induce an heritable change. The size of the small proportion of susceptible cells can be influenced significantly by a number of factors; when all the factors now to be listed are operating the frequency has not exceeded 1:1000. The Type of Origin of Recipient Cells.-Type a exhibits the lowest frequency, about 1:10,000,000, and type d the highest, approximately 1 per 1000 cells exposed. This type-specific property which controls the frequency of susceptible cells is an inherited trait; repeated change to a heterologous type shows no influence on the incidence of these cells. Concentration of DNA.-Within certain limits increase in the concentration of DNA controlling streptomycin resistance can increase the size of the proportion of cells in which streptomycin resistance can be induced. However, increases in concentrations greater than 10(-1) microg. per ml. have not induced streptomycin resistance in a higher proportion of cells. Phase of Growth Cycle.-Predictable fluctuations in frequency of induced heritable changes have been demonstrated in both Rb and Rd populations during growth. There is no evidence that susceptible cells reproduce their kind; they emerge in all experiments when the population reaches the end of the logarithmic period and a density of 2 to 4 x 10(8) cells per ml. In the early logarithmic phase it is difficult to demonstrate the presence of susceptible cells. The peak frequency of susceptible cells occurs in the early stationary phase of the growth cycle. Thereafter, the decline in frequency is a gradual one. The data suggest that in a given population the same cells are susceptible to a number of different type-specific DNA's and the DNA controlling SM resistance. Comparison of Frequency of Cells Susceptible to Different DNA's.-In a given population the frequency of cells susceptible to different type-specific DNA's and the DNA controlling streptomycin resistance is not significantly different. Competition between Type-Specific DNA's-The data suggest that DNA's of types a, b, and c compete for the same cells in Rd populations. When Rd populations are exposed simultaneously to 2 of these 3 DNA's in different concentrations the proportion which each type contributes to the total type-specific cells induced is closely correlated with the concentration of the corresponding DNA. Exclusion of DNA's.-Induction of one type specificity or streptomycin resistance can be completely prevented in a population containing susceptible cells by previous exposure for 15 minutes to a 1000-fold higher concentration of another type-specific DNA.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Haemophilus influenzae","Nucleic Acids"],"pmid":"13163325","title":"Studies on the nature of hemophilus influenzae cells susceptible to heritable changes by desoxyribonucleic acids.","year":"1954"},

{"abstractText":"Attempts were made to \"convert\" highly virulent strains of the 3 immunologic types of poliomyelitis virus (Mahoney, Y-SK, and Leon) into avirulent variants. Tests involving intracerebral, intramuscular, or oral administration of virus to cynomolgus monkeys indicated that mere propagation in cultures of kidney tissue of cynomolgus monkeys had no effect on virulence when single or small numbers of virus particles were used as seed, and harvests were delayed for 24 hours or more after the appearance of cytopathogenic change. On the other hand, passages at 24 hour intervals with large inocula (10(5) to 10(6) TCD(60)) produced culture fluids with diminished virulence and unusual patterns of response in cynomolgus monkeys. Purification of such culture fluids by the terminal dilution technique yielded modified strains which proved to be avirulent after administration by the intracerebral, intramuscular, or oral routes in cynomolgus monkeys. Neither paralysis nor CNS lesions were found in any of more than 80 monkeys inoculated intracerebrally with various amounts of virus. However, focal neuronal lesions were found in the spinal cord of 3 of 48 monkeys inoculated intramuscularly with various amounts of the Mahoney variant, in 2 of 20 receiving the Y-SK variant, though in none of 40 inoculated with various amounts of the Leon variant. Virus recovered from the spinal cord of one of the monkeys in the Mahoney group produced no paralysis on intracerebral passage in monkeys. It is assumed that all 3 modified viruses possess a limited capacity to affect lower motor neurones of cynomolgus monkeys when these are directly exposed to them by accidental intraneural or traumatic intracerebral injection. On propagation in cynomolgus kidney cultures the modified viruses reached titers of approximately 10(7) TCD(50) per ml., as measured by cytopathogenic activity on renal epithelial cells in vitro, yet produced no perceptible pathologic changes in the muscles, kidneys, testes, ovaries, heart, pancreas, adrenals, liver, or spleen of cynomolgus monkeys inoculated intramuscularly. The modified viruses were immunogenic after intramuscular injection, but a large proportion of cynomolgus monkeys failed to develop antibody after small doses, indicating that in this host the experimentally produced variants multiplied less readily in non-nervous tissue than the virulent parent strains. Tests with the Type 1 virus showed that the orally administered avirulent variant can induce the formation of antibody and bring about resistance to the occurrence of paralysis such as results from ingestion of the virulent, parent strain. The Types 1 and 2 modified viruses are paralytogenic in mice after direct spinal inoculation whereas the Type 3 virus is not. The Type 1 virus became paralytogenic for mice when it lost its virulence for cynomolgus monkeys by the indicated routes. The Type 2 virus lost its virulence for mice by the intracerebral but not intraspinal routes when it was still fully virulent for cynomolgus monkeys, and retained its paralytogenic activity in intraspinally inoculated mice after it had lost its virulence for cynomolgus monkeys by the indicated routes. The parent Type 3 virus was paralytogenic in intraspinally inoculated mice when it was still fully virulent for cynomolgus monkeys, but this property disappeared in the modified virus when it became avirulent for monkeys.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Poliovirus"],"pmid":"13163327","title":"Studies on variants of poliomyelitis virus.

{"abstractText":"The usefulness of the deembryonation technic has been analyzed as a tool in the study of various problems in the growth cycle of influenza virus in the entodermal cells of the allantoic of chick embryos. Various improvements in the deembryonation technic have been described. The method readily permits repeated sampling of the medium at various stages after infection (cumulative growth curves) or frequent exchanges of the medium (differential growth curve). However, the yield of infectious virus or of hemagglutinins is less than that observed in the intact chick embryo. The difference observed is greater than can be accounted for by the reduction in the available host cells and is assumed, therefore, to be due in part to interruption of blood and nutrient supply to the cells. This handicap can be overcome by the combined in ovo-deembryonation technic, in which deembryonation is performed at any desired time after infection of the intact chick embryo, and the medium is collected and analyzed after 1 to 3 hours of further incubation. The value of the technic is demonstrated by the fact that liberation of virus from infected cells can be detected earlier than in the intact egg. Furthermore, it continues at a nearly constant rate for many hours, thus proving to be erroneous previous inference which had been based upon in ovo experiments. The technic also permits readily the addition and subsequent removal of substances that might interfere with viral propagation. As an example a study was made of the effect of the receptor-destroying enzyme of V. cholerae (RDE) when added to the medium of eggs infected prior to deembryonation. By carefully grading the dose of virus and using an appropriate amount of RDE, one-step growth curves were obtained indicating that those cells not directly invaded by the seed virus were subsequently protected against infection by action of the enzyme. The smaller the amount of virus the less RDE was required in order to note a protective effect. With a decrease in the period of exposure to RDE regeneration of cell receptors became increasingly more apparent in that correspondingly greater amounts of virus were produced and liberated late in the incubation periods. These results confirmed and extended those reported by Stone. More extensive applications of these technics will be reported in subsequent papers of this series.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"13163337","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system.","year":"1954"},
{"abstractText":"The period and rate of liberation of influenza virus from entodermal cells of the allantois have been studied by deembryonating eggs within a few minutes after infection, exchanging the medium thereafter at hourly intervals and assaying the virus concentration in the harvests thus obtained (differential growth curves). If the inoculum was sufficiently large, presumably all available cells immediately became infected and only 1 infectious cycle was expected to occur. If the inoculum was small, so that only a fraction of the cells adsorbed virus, the infectious process was held to 1 cycle by continuous exposure of the remaining susceptible cells to RDE. In either case, the results obtained indicate that once cells have been infected they produce and liberate virus at nearly constant rates for periods of 30 hours or longer before the yields decrease rapidly. Evidence has been presented which strongly suggests that such prolonged periods of liberation are observed not only in deembryonated eggs but also in the intact chick embryo. Attempts have been made in the discussion to reconcile these findings with previous estimates of the liberation period and to integrate them with histologic observations and electron micrographs of thin sections of infected allantoic membranes having a bearing on the mode of liberation.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"13163338","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system.

All these factors were found to influence the survival rate of the virus particles. Five freeze-thaw cycles resulted in a fall in titre from 10(-8.6) to 10(-0.8) cycles 2, 3, and 4 causing much greater losses than cycles 1 and 5. Rapid cooling to -40 degrees C. or slow cooling to -80 or 190 degrees C. did not cause significant titre loss, but rapid cooling to temperatures above -40 degrees or slow cooling to temperatures above -80 degrees C. caused definite titre loss. Loss of titre on storage occurred only at temperatures above -40deg;C. The effect of lyophilization depends both on the preliminary treatment and on the dehydration temperature. Better conservation of titre was obtained after preliminary cooling to -190 or -80 degrees C. than after preliminary cooling to higher temperatures. The most effective sublimation temperatures were 0 and -80 degrees .; the least effective was +20 degrees C. Titre losses in suspensions sublimated at -10, -30, and -60 degrees C. were in general intermediate. No loss in titre occurred after preliminary cooling to -80 or -190 degrees C. and subsequent dehydration at -80 or 0 degrees C. The degree of dehydration definitely affects the survival of virus on storage at 0 degrees C., but sublimation for 4 hours at 0 degrees C. gave complete protection against titre loss on storage at this temperature. Possible explanations of the observations made are suggested, based on known physiochemical phenomena such as supercooling, vitrification, variations in size and shape of ice crystals with different freezing speeds, differential enzyme inactivation, changes in salt concentration, and changes in energy levels.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Histology","Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"13163341","title":"The effects on biological materials of freezing and drying by vacuum sublimation.

{"abstractText":"The phenomenon of apparent loss of group-specific carbohydrate in the course of mouse passage of group A streptococci has been subjected to further study, and several additional variants showing this property have been described. The loss of group reactivity is shown to be due to an alteration in the chemical structure and serological specificity of the cell wall carbohydrate. This alteration appears to be essentially the same in each of the variants available for study. The carbohydrate of the variant strains (V) contains the same two monosaccharide components as the group A carbohydrate (A), but they are present in different proportions. Precipitating sera reactive with V carbohydrate have been prepared, and the A and V carbohydrates have been compared by qualitative and quantitative precipitin analysis. A second type of variation has been encountered during mouse passage. This variation is characterized by the occurrence of a cell wall carbohydrate (I) intermediate in chemical and serological properties between the A and V carbohydrates. The I carbohydrate reacts with both A and V antisera and does not appear to be a simple mixture of A and V carbohydrate.

The final contraction of the cell body and the change into a mass of granules were often very sudden. Vacuoles often developed in the neuron. There was no recovery. Astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and macrophages were affected by the virus but not as quickly as the neurons. The age of the tissue culture was not a factor when the cells were in good condition. The age of the individual donor of the brain tissue was a factor; the fetal brain cells appeared to be more sensitive to the virus than the adult brain cells. The fetal neurons often reacted (1\/2) hour after inoculation while the adult neurons reacted more slowly, 2 to 24 hours after inoculation.

The latter optimum concentrations of the individual amino acids were closely correlated with their serum levels. With at least six of the amino acids, high concentrations, in the range 1 to 10 microM per ml., caused a definite growth inhibition.

{"abstractText":"The kidney carcinoma of the leopard frog has served for various studies on catalase activity, as a first step in gaining information on enzymatic properties of neoplasms in cold blooded animals. It was found that the activity level of this tumor is reduced to approximately 13 per cent of that of the normal frog's kidney. Systemic effects of the tumor on catalase activity of liver and kidney are evident. Liver catalase in tumor-bearing frogs is diminished to about 50 per cent of the normal, and kidney catalase to an even greater degree; i.e., to about 34 per cent. A positive correlation exists between levels of catalase in tumor and in liver. Frogs kept at 3 different temperatures, 8, 18, and 26.5 degrees C., for upward of 29 days exhibited no significant change in activity levels either of tumor or of livers from normal or from tumor-bearing animals. It is suggested that a seasonal variation may occur in catalase activity of the frog. During the winter months catalase activity of the tumors was found to be higher than during the summer, whereas liver catalase was below the level of normal frogs examined during the summer. Intracoelomic injections of homogenates of tumors promptly lead to diminution of liver catalase lasting for several days. Injection of normal kidney has no such effect. These results with a spontaneous tumor of a cold blooded animal are in essential agreement with the many observations made with transplanted tumors of warm blooded animals.

{"abstractText":"Procedures which make possible the enumeration of both infective and hemagglutinating influenza A virus particles have been developed and used in a quantitative investigation on the reproduction of the agent. Infective particles were found to be highly unstable and their half-life was only 147 minutes in allantoic fluid at 35 degrees C. both in vitro and in vivo. The instability of infective particles provides an explanation for the rapid accumulation of non-infective particles which retained the hemagglutinating property. The number of non-infective (N) particles was determined from the difference between the number of hemagglutinating (H) particles and the number of infective (I) particles as indicated by the relation: [N] = [H]- [1]. When the half-life of infective particles was taken into account, both infective and hemagglutinating particles were found to disappear from the allantoic fluid; i.e., were adsorbed by the allantoic membrane, at the same logarithmic rate after inoculation. Inoculation of any number of particles up to 3 x 10(7) was followed by a constant and progressive decrease in the proportion of unadsorbed particles from 0 to 4 hours. Approximately 20 per cent of particles were unadsorbed at 2 hours and about 5 per cent at 4 hours. Inoculation of 3 x 10(8) or more particles led to a larger proportion of unadsorbed particles at 4 hours. The maximum number of particles adsorbed was computed to be about 1.6 x 10(9). The concentration of both infective and hemagglutinating particles increased rapidly in the allantoic fluid after 4 hours when any number of infective particles up to 3 x 10(7) was inoculated. With such inocula, the rate of increase during the logarithmic period was constant and the time to double the concentration of infective or hemagglutinating particles was 46 minutes. With larger inocula, i.e. 3 x 10(8) particles, the concentrations of infective and hemagglutinating particles did not increase until after 8 hours and the rate of increase was much slower. The time to double the concentration of either then became 92 minutes. The number of infective particles was approximately equal to the number of hemagglutinating particles during the logarithmic increase period when any number of infective particles up to 3 x 10(6) was inoculated and no more than 10(6) non-infective particles were included in the inoculum. This finding was taken to indicate that all or almost all particles produced and released under these conditions were infective. That such particles became inactivated rapidly and led to the accumulation of an increasing number of non-infective particles after the logarithmic period can be explained by the short half-life of infective particles. The number of infective particles was no larger than one-tenth the number of hemagglutinating particles during the logarithmic increase period after 3 x 10(7) or more infective particles had been inoculated or when smaller inocula were used which also contained 3 x 10(7) or more non-infective particles. Non-infective particles prepared in vitro at 35 degrees or 22 degrees C. were as effective as those which accumulated in vivo in diminishing the proportion of infective particles in the yield. The extent of the reduction in the proportion of infective particles was directly related to the number of non-infective particles included in the inoculum. The yield of hemagglutinating particles was diminished when the inoculum contained 3 x 10(7) or more non-infective particles. The rate of increase was reduced so that the time to double the concentration became 92 minutes when the inoculum contained 3 x 10(8) non-infective particles. It appears from these findings that the single condition which will lead to the emergence of non-infective particles during the logarithmic period is a high initial particle-cell ratio. Because non-infective particles are equally as effective as infective particles in producing this result, it seems probable that the appearance of non-infective but hemagglutinating particles is not a necessary accompaniment of the reproductive process.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"13286420","title":"On the reproduction of influenza virus; quantitative studies with procedures which enumerate infective and hemagglutinating virus particles.","year":"1954"},

{"abstractText":"Electron microscopic study has revealed the morphological entity responsible for the rise in viral hemagglutinin observed in brains of mice after intracerebral inoculation of non-neurotropic strains of influenza virus. This rise in hemagglutinin, although dependent on inoculation of fully infectious virus, is not associated with an increase in infectious titer. The hemagglutinating principle is functionally similar to the \"incomplete\" influenza virus which can be obtained from chick embryos by serial egg-to-egg transfer of undiluted, infected allantoic fluid according to the method of von Magnus. A method has been described which facilitates selective adsorption of viral particles recovered from organ extracts on saponine-lysed ghosts of fowl erythrocytes. This procedure has been utilized in studying the morphology of non-infectious, hemagglutinating virus from chorio-allantoic membranes or mouse brains and in comparing these two forms with each other and with ordinary, infectious (standard) influenza virus. Standard virus isolated from allantoic fluids or membranes of infected eggs was found to contain uniform particles of predominantly spherical shape with smooth surface and even density, resembling those described by others. The appearance of such particles was not affected by the procedure of extraction and concentration used. In contrast, non-infectious, hemagglutinating virus obtained either from allantoic sacs (\"undiluted passages\") or from mouse brain was pleomorphic and seemed to consist of disintegrating particles. The majority appeared flattened and bag-like and had a rough, granular surface and reduced, uneven density. 37 per cent of the non-infectious particles isolated from mouse brain infected with the non-neurotropic strain WS had diameters in excess of 170 mmicro, as compared with only 2 per cent of the particles of the parent strain itself. Regardless of whether or not the contrast in appearance of standard and of non-infectious particles was due to differing resistance to the preparatory treatment, it indicated the existence of basic structural differences between the two types of virus. Correlation of particle counts with hemagglutinin titers has shown that the non-infectious virus obtained from mouse brain is, unit for unit, an equivalent counterpart of standard virus derived from infected eggs. The end-point of hemagglutination in a pattern test corresponds for both forms to that dilution at which the ratio virus particles\/red cells approaches one. The quantitative data based on particle counts support the assumption that non-infectious virus arises in mouse brain as a product of viral multiplication.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Microscopy, Electron","Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"13286424","title":"Morphological and quantitative comparison between infectious and non-infectious forms of influenza virus.","year":"1954"},

Intraperitoneal injection of distilled water caused osmotic disruption of the mast cells and the appearance of an appreciable amount of histamine in the peritoneal fluid. Injection of Tyrode solution alone was not particularly damaging to the mast cells and little or no histamine was released. Injection of Tyrode solution containing compound 48\/80 resulted in extensive release of granules from mast cells and the appearance of large amounts of histamine in the fluid.

A series of increasing doses of compound 48\/80 had a graded morphological effect upon mast cells and resulted in a graded increase in the amount of histamine that appeared in the peritoneal fluid. It is unlikely therefore that this compound acts by simply lysing the plasma membrane.

In each case aliquots of the same cell suspension were either incubated at 37 degrees C. for 24 hours or heated at 52 degrees C. for 20 minutes and then injected into other normal rabbits, as controls. In the case of lymph node cells obtained 4 or 3 days after the injection of antigen, antibody was found in the serum of recipients on the 1st day after the transfer of untreated cells. The titer increased until the 3rd day and then began to decline after the 5th or 7th day.

This late appearance of antibody was attributed to the presence of small amounts of antigen in the original cell suspension. As the interval between injection of antigen and collection of cells was increased beyond 4 days the effectiveness of the transfer decreased progressively until at 14 days no transfer effect was obtained. When cells which were obtained 2 days after the injection of antigen were transferred, antibody appeared on the 2nd day after transfer and then followed the characteristic curve, whereas in the case of incubated cells antibody did not appear until the 3rd day after transfer.

Under these optimal conditions, uninfected suspensions of monocytes exhibited little change in cell numbers over a period of 40 to 72 hours. Infection of monocytes with the virulent H37Rv strain of tubercle bacillus resulted in an early degeneration of a certain proportion of the cells cultivated in the presence of normal rabbit serum. This degeneration was apparent not only for cells of tuberculin-negative animals but also for those derived from tuberculin-positive animals. The serum of animals vaccinated with BCG exerted a favorable effect upon the survival of monocytes infected with virulent tubercle bacilli.

{"abstractText":"Experimental evidence is presented for drastic changes in phosphomonoesterase activities of tissue cultures, brought about by infection with poliomyelitis viruses. Acid phosphatase activity went through a maximum before decreasing almost to zero level. Alkaline phosphatase activity diminished progressively to zero, then with disruption of the cells attamed normal levels. Various aspects of the kinetics were investigated and illustrated. The initial increase of acid phosphatase, in contrast with the alkaline, may mean that the reactions catalyzed by this enzyme continue during the early phase. This period is the time of intense virus production and therefore it was supposed that this enzyme may play some role in virus synthesis. It was assumed that the virus acts as a particle of molecular size and becomes associated with the enzyme complex physicochemically or chemically. This association ends with the disintegration of the host cells. During the cell-virus interaction a toxin may develop which is a strong and general enzyme inhibitor. Various enzyme systems differ in sensitivity toward these virus effects; for instance, acid phosphatase is irreversibly inhibited or may be destroyed. The visible CPE of virus is preceded by a drastic reduction of enzyme activities in whole TC and in its various fractions, which may suggest causal relationship in the mechanism of cell destruction. In arrested or latent infection these processes are operative, but on a smaller scale. The drop in activities cannot be explained by the reduction of tissue mass, which is the consequence, rather than the cause, of enzyme changes. Besides the theoretical significance of these observations the following practical points can be summarized: 1. Changes in phosphatase activities are most strikingly demonstrated in whole tissue cultures inoculated with poliomyelitis virus. 2. There is causal relationship among infection, enzyme changes, and transformation of cell physiology. 3. The biochemical approach provides a quantitative measure of the extent of cell damage, before visible CPE is detectible. 4. Unapparent and active infections with poliomyelitis virus could be differentiated from normal controls by this method. 5. By various manipulations (freezing, long incubation) the difference between normal and infected TC can be enhanced. Suitable technical methods were proposed for various types of investigations.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases","Poliovirus"],"pmid":"13367332","title":"Comparative biochemical studies on normal and on poliomyelitis virus-infected tissue cultures.

{"abstractText":"Tissue culture strains of cells from four different normal human tissues-liver, conjunctiva, kidney, and appendix-have been grown by the plating procedure previously developed for the HeLa strain of cervical carcinoma cells. This technique results in colony formation from isolated single cells, in a manner completely analogous to the plating of bacteria in semisolid nutrient media. Clonal cell strains have been isolated from each cell type. All behaved exactly alike in all properties studied except that some differences in plating efficiency were displayed in some of the growth media employed. The cells from normal human tissues resembled the HeLa S3 carcinomatous cell in the following properties:- (a) Single cells displayed a plating efficiency close to 100 per cent in an appropriate medium. (b) They all grew as an epithelial sheet on glass, the cells being closely packed and polygonal in shape. (c) They had mean generation times of 20 to 23 hours in the nutrient media employed, (d) The mitotic frequency was constant, and therefore the duration of mitosis was the same for all the strains studied, (e) The incidence of multinuclearity and giant formation was very low and similar in both types of cells. (f) Both classes of cells had the same total volume, and the same nuclear cross-sectional area. (g) Both also showed a tendency to spread more in the presence of human serum (concentration of 20 per cent or more) than in porcine serum. However, this differential morphological response was much more marked in the HeLa cell than in those from normal tissues. The only difference noted in the behavior of these two groups of cells lay in the tendency of the cells from normal tissues always to exhibit a greater cross-sectional area when spread on glass than the HeLa cell in the same medium. The frequency of occurrence of different types of multinuclearity in the HeLa cell and cells from normal tissues has been measured. The data suggest that multinuclearity depends on two factors: a necessary, predisposing state in the cell, and a random, independent event causing the appearance of an additional nucleus in such a prepared cell.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Epithelium","Tissue Culture Techniques"],"pmid":"13367333","title":"Clonal growth in vitro of epithelial cells from normal human tissues.","year":"1956"},
{"abstractText":"Soil organisms have been isolated which elaborate induced enzymes capable of attacking group A and variant (V) streptococcal carbohydrates. The V enzyme hydrolyzes V carbohydrate extensively to dialyzable split products with resultant total loss of precipitating activity with homologous antisera. The split products inhibit the reaction between intact V carbohydrate and its antiserum: evidence is presented which indicates that rhamnose oligosaccharides are responsible for the inhibitory effect. The serological specificity of the V carbohydrate thus appears to be primarily dependent on a rhamnose-rhamnose linkage. The effect of the A enzyme on A carbohydrate is characterized by the removal of 50 to 70 per cent of the total glucosamine in the form of free N-acetyl-glucosamine. As a result of this treatment, the residual carbohydrate loses its reactivity with specific group A antisera and at the same time develops markedly increased cross-reactivity with V antisera. This cross-reactivity is in turn eliminated by treatment with V enzyme. The evidence suggests that the specificity of group A carbohydrate is determined to a large extent by side chains of N-acetyl-glucosamine which also serve to mask underlying rhamnose-rhamnose linkages with V specificity.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Carbohydrate Metabolism","Streptococcus"],"pmid":"13367334","title":"Variation in the group-specific carbohydrate of group A streptococci.

{"abstractText":"Guinea pigs infected by intradermal injection of living toxigenic diphtheria bacilli and protected by horse antitoxic globulin, given either before or after infection, develop delayed hypersensitivity of the tuberculin type to diphtherial proteins. The highest degree of hypersensitivity is specifically directed against diphtheria toxin (or toxoid) itself, although smaller delayed skin reactions may be evoked in sensitized animals by other diphtherial proteins common to both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains. Animals sensitized to diphtheria toxin by infection with a toxigenic strain in this way react positively to the Schick test and their serum usually contains no detectable antitoxin 2 to 3 weeks after the initial infection. Animals infected with living non-toxigenic diphtheria bacilli become sensitized to proteins common to both toxigenic and non-toxigenic strains but do not show sensitivity to toxin. The observations suggest that a minute amount of toxoid, or of toxin comparable to that which might be liberated during infection, might induce the hypersensitive state if injected in the form of a complex with excess antitoxin.

These studies disclosed that either one or two periods of parabiosis resulted in the same persistent modification of classical host-homograft interactions. This modification was characterized by the replacement of the customary basic or sensitized homologous incompatibility reactions by a reaction more easily interpreted as one of host-graft tolerance or indifference. The intense inflammatory aspects of the usual host-homograft interactions were absent. Penetration of the musculofascial graft by vascularized mesenchyme derived from the host was retarded.

The induction of these effects previously was considered to be peculiar to estriol. The unusual growth properties common to impeded estrogens are twofold: (a) after the threshold dosage required to initiate growth has been reached, the slope of the curve of increment of uterine weight in response to increased steroid dosage is very gradual rather than steep; (b) these compounds possess the ability to inhibit to a limited extent the uterine growth induced by estrone administered concurrently. The partial inhibition of estrone-induced growth of the uterus is confined to a critical dosage of the impeded estrogen and is overcome by increased dosage of the inhibitor. Estrone-induced growth of the vagina is not inhibited by impeded estrogens. Furthermore the simultaneous administration of impeded estrogens and testosterone does not lessen the amount of uterine growth evoked by the latter. The impeded estrogens so far encountered are 3-hydroxyestratriene derivatives possessing either a ketone group at position 6 or a hydroxyl group at position 16.

Although DNAP and crude RNAP fractions were active, activity could not be associated with either RNA or DNA. The fraction possessing the highest concentration of activity was a residue fraction which was insoluble in water or in dilute or strong saline solutions. Extraction of lyophilized tumor with acetone or 3:1 alcohol:ether reduced, but did not eliminate, activity in the insoluble fraction. However, activity was completely lost after extraction with 80 per cent alcohol at room temperature. Enhancing activity of a tumor fraction was irreversibly lost after exposure for 1 hour to a solution more acid than pH 5 or more alkaline than pH 9. Activity was completely lost after exposure to 50 per cent urea or 90 per cent phenol. Activity was not altered by incubation with trypsin, hyaluronidase, DNAase or the receptor-destroying enzyme of V. cholerae, but it was decreased when trypsin or hyaluronidase was injected with the incubated tumor fraction. Activity was rapidly destroyed by treatment with dilute solutions of sodium periodate at pH 7. Under similar conditions, treatment with KMnO(4) resulted in less extensive destruction of activity while H(2)O(2), K(2)Cr(2)O(7), and NaIO(4) previously inactivated by reaction with glucose had no apparent effect on activity.

Pathological alterations of the nuclei of affected cells occur in a definite sequence of stages. In the earliest, and acidophilic Feulgen-negative intranuclear inclusion body is recognizable. Subsequently the inclusion body and nucleus enlarge, there is progressive disorganization of nuclear structure, and the inclusion body then becomes basophilic and stains with the Feulgen reaction. The nucleus finally disappears, leaving the inclusion body in the cell remnant. The relative amounts of Feulgen-colored DNA per cell at each stage in the evolution of the lesion in the infected cells, as well as in normal appearing and hypertrophic cells of the papilloma, were measured microphotometrically in Feulgen preparations. Determinations were made using the \"plug\" and \"two wave length\" methods. These are compared with measurements of DNA in cells of the basal and spinous layers of normal human skin. The frequency distribution curves of relative amount of DNA in cells of normal skin, and normal-appearing cells in hyperplastic epithelium, show the bimodal diploid and tetraploid peaks characteristic of growing tissues. Infection of the epidermal cell entails prompt synthesis of DNA in the nucleus. Increased amounts of DNA (tetraploid to 16 ploid levels) are found in the earliest recognizable cytopathological stages of infection and do not increase appreciably during the subsequent evolution of the cellular lesion. At a relatively late stage, all the cellular DNA is relocated (\"transferred\" or \"reassembled\") in the inclusion body, and is not further significantly increased in amount.

{"abstractText":"Leeches, fed on swine infected with hog cholera, contained virus for as long as 87 days after their infective blood meals. In three instances, infected leeches apparently transmitted hog cholera virus to susceptible swine in the process of normal feeding. Myxoma virus persisted in leeches for as long as 154 days after the ingestion of a blood meal from rabbits with myxomatosis. Leeches fed consecutively, first on swine with hog cholera, and later on rabbits with myxomatosis, acquired both viruses. In such dually infected leeches, the hog cholera virus persisted for as long as 122 days and the myxoma virus for as long as 110 days, the longest periods tested. Leeches fed consecutively, first on rabbits with myxomatosis, and later on swine with hog cholera, acquired only the myxoma virus. Hog cholera virus could not be demonstrated in such dually fed leeches. Myxoma and hog cholera viruses appeared to be present in about equivalent amounts in the anterior and posterior thirds of the bodies of infected leeches. Myxoma and hog cholera viruses were present in the bloody gut contents of infected leeches but were not demonstrable in the body tissues of these leeches. It seems from the findings presented that leeches are not biological carriers of either myxoma or hog cholera virus but instead carry these two agents mechanically in their gastrointestinal tracts. In doing this, they appear to protect the viruses from various deleterious chemical and physical influences to which they would have been exposed in the open. It is speculated that leeches could play a role in nature in perpetuating the blood-borne viruses of certain diseases in which close association with bodies of fresh water is of epidemiological importance.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Leeches","Swine Diseases","Virus Diseases"],"pmid":"13416474","title":"The leech as a potential virus reservoir.","year":"1957"},
{"abstractText":"A method has been described for the preparation of a potent antibacterial factor from rabbit polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Upon characterization, the factor was found to possess many properties in common with basic proteins. The amino acid analysis revealed that it contained a relatively large amount of arginine (17 per cent) and small amounts of the other two basic amino acids. It has therefore been identified as a protamine or protamine derivative. The leucocyte factor was very active against all Gram-positive pathogens tested but exhibited little or no action against Gram-negative species. A possible explanation of this phenomenon has been discussed. The factor was very heat-stable at acid and neutral pH and its staphylococcidal activity was blocked by glutamyl polypeptide, hyaluronic acid, and desoxyribonudeic acid. Because of the apparent similarity of the product studied here to other poorly defined leucocyte factors which had been termed leukins in the early literature, it is suggested that the name leukin be retained for it.

{"abstractText":"A marked increase of the serum beta globulins was found in rabbits developing amyloidosis as a result of prolonged treatment with ribonucleate administered by subcutaneous injections. Following cessation of treatment the beta globulin levels gradually returned to normal while the gamma globulin levels rose strikingly, the changes being accompanied by a resorption of amyloid from the spleen, and probably also from the kidneys. Electrophoretic studies provided some evidence that the increase in beta globulins which accompanied the development of amyloidosis resulted from the production of a globulin not normally present in rabbit serum. A protein or protein derivative that moved as a beta globulin when subjected to filter paper electrophoresis was excreted in substantial quantities in the urine of several amyloidotic rabbits, along with much smaller quantities of substances moving as albumin, alpha and gamma globulins. Considered as a whole, the findings indicate a causal relationship between the abnormal production of circulating beta globulins and the deposition of amyloid in rabbits treated with ribonucleate.

The resulting infection is inapparent in that there is no obvious interference with normal embryonic development and no evidences of injury can be detected by the light microscope. Hemophilus influenzae, type b thrives luxuriantly in the amniotic fluid of embryonated eggs inoculated by the intra-amniotic route on the 15th day of incubation. The effects of the establishment of the bacterial infection in the embryo are noted by the occurrence of death, bacteriemia or characteristic inflammatory lesions in the form of purulent sinusitis, pharyngitis, tracheo-bronchitis and meningo-encephalitis. These lesions may occur singly or in various combinations. The incidence and severity of disease manifestations in infected embryos depends on the proportion of encapsulated and virulent bacilli in the inoculum, the number of infectious doses and the growth rate of the bacteria in the surrounding amniotic fluid. Combined viral and bacterial infection established by intra-amniotic inoculation with influenza C virus on the 14th followed by Hemophilus influenzae, type b on the 15th incubation day brings about a significant increase in the incidence and severity of disease manifestations in the embryos. Selective survival and marked acceleration of the growth rate of encapsulated and virulent elements of the bacterial population is promoted in the virus-infected embryos. The disease process appears to be entirely attributable to the bacterial component. There seems to be relatively little or no effect on influenza C virus by the accompanying proliferation of Hemophilus.

The epiphyses were separated from the diaphyses for analysis. From the diaphyses freed of bone marrow about 82 per cent of the S(35) which they contained was extracted with a 2.5 N solution of sodium hydroxide. More, about 91 per cent of the S(35), was thus extracted from the epiphyses. Dialysis of the extracts against water showed that the fraction of S(35) which was dialyzable decreased rapidly with time. After 1 hour about 80 per cent and 50 per cent of the S(35) in the extracts of diaphyses and epiphyses, respectively were found in the dialysates, after 24 hours about 20 per cent and 4 per cent, and after 120 hours 12 per cent and 1 per cent. Similar values for the S(35) in inorganic sulfate were found when the extracts were chromatographed on an anion exchange resin, dowex-2. The S(35), other than inorganic sulfate, was in the form of bound sulfate, which was released by acid hydrolysis. Uronic acid and hexosamines, primarily galactosamine, were associated with the S(35). Indeed, on paper electrophoretograms and paper chromatograms the major S(35)-labelled component which was seen resembled chondroitin sulfate in its mobility. On the paper chromatograms, also a second S(35)-labelled component with a mobility lower than that of chondroitin sulfate was found. It is unlikely that the latter is a breakdown product of chondroitin sulfate, produced in the course of extraction with the sodium hydroxide solution. In fact, both components were also found in sodium versenate homogenates which had been dialyzed extensively against water. On the basis of these results it is suggested that the greatest part of the S(35)-labelled materials previously demonstrated by autoradiography to be progressively deposited in the metaphyses after 24 hours,-as the concentration of S(35)-sulfate concurrently decreased in the epiphyseal cartilage plates,-are akin to the chondroitin sulfate of the epiphyseal cartilage plates and are derived from the latter.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Bone and Bones","Epiphyses","Sulfates"],"pmid":"13475610","title":"Turnover of S35-sulfate in epiphyses and diaphyses of suckling rats; nature of the S35-labelled compounds.","year":"1957"},

The former was limited to the outer zone of the medulla, the latter to its inner zone. In the proximal convolution the structural alteration began in its middle third and extended downward towards the medulla; only occasional nephrons were affected. The essential nature of the more severe epithelial lesion was similar in both collecting tubule and proximal convolution, beginning as a swelling of cell bodies, increasing to protoplasmic disturbances with disintegration of the mitochondrial pattern, followed by rupture of cells and nuclear disappearance. These retrogressive alterations were followed by prolific regenerative hyperplasia. In the collecting tubules of the outer zone these epithelial alterations were present in both the clear and the intercalcated cells; in the latter the swelling of the cells was not prominent, but the hyperplastic proliferative increase in their number was the predominating feature of the lesion when the dissected tubules were viewed intact in the continuity of their topographical relations. The cellular alterations in the tubules are associated with an inability to concentrate the urine; reasons are given for considering this functional disturbance a correlate of the structural lesion in the collecting tubules.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Kidney","Potassium Deficiency"],"pmid":"13475614","title":"The renal lesions of electrolyte imbalance.

Binding of the basic dye methyl green to DNA was uniformly found to be depressed in L.E. bodies as compared with control nuclei. Since Feulgen-revealed DNA, which served as a standard of reference, was relatively unchanged in amount, the Feulgen:methyl green ratios of L.E. bodies were higher than those of lymphocyte nuclei. Acetylation, which covers basic groups of proteins, was found to increase methyl green uptake by DNA of L.E. bodies to values approximating those of control nuclei, with consequent revision, after acetylation of the Feulgen: methyl green ratios of L.E. bodies to values similar to those of lymphocyte nuclei. Ribonuclease was found to reduce methyl green staining; extraction with dilute acid had little effect. These data have been interpreted to indicate (a) the presence in L.E. bodies of DNA-associated proteins whose basic groups compete with the cationic dye for binding sites of DNA and so inhibit methyl green staining, and (b) the DNA itself is not detectibly altered in state or degree of polymerization.

{"abstractText":"The cellular sites of formation of gammaglobulin in lymphatic tissues of man and in a representative human lymphoid infiltrate have been studied by fluorescent antibody technique. The findings indicate that gamma-globulin is formed in the germinal centers of lymphatic nodules and in the cytoplasm of mature and immature plasma cells of two types-those with and those without Russell bodies. The germinal center cells that synthesize gamma-globulin have been designated \"intrinsic\" cells to distinguish them from the medium and large lymphocytes, and the primitive reticular cells that occur elsewhere and do not produce gamma-globulin. Unlike the plasma cells, which function as individual units, the intrinsic cells apparently form gamma-globulin only when they are arranged in discrete aggregations. The function, the blood supply, and the systematic cellular arrangement of germinal centers justifies the postulate that they are miniature organs of internal secretion of gamma-globulin. The release of gamma-globulin from its sites of formation appears to be accomplished by holocrine and apocrine secretion. Presumably, these secretory mechanisms are adaptations required for the production of antibody since they have not been described in parenchymal cells that form the other serum proteins. The cells found to form gamma-globulin appear to be identical with those previously shown to form specific antibody in response to a variety of antigens in the experimental animal. This evidence indicates that normal gamma-globulin, if it exists, originates in the same cells that produce antibody.

The observations presented indicate that early in the course of each of these diseases alterations occur in the fine structure of the glomeruli which serve to distinguish one disease process from another. In nephrosis, some distortion of the organization of the epithelial foot processes was seen in all patients. These epithelial changes constituted the early, consistent lesion of the disease. There was frequently also a swelling of the endothelium. In glomerulonephritis, pronounced proliferative changes involving the endothelium and to a lesser extent the epithelium, together with the laying down of a basement membrane-like material, represented the predominate pathologic processes. There was also a swelling of both endothelial and epithelial cytoplasm. The epithelial foot processes generally appeared normal. In patients with a clinically \"mixed\" picture of nephrosis and nephritis, the glomerular changes were likewise \"mixed,\" for various combinations of epithelial, endothelial, and basement membrane abnormalities were present. In disseminated lupus erythematosus, a more or less generalized thickening of the basement membrane proper associated with a variable degree of endothelial proliferation was seen. It is suggested that an accentuation of the process of basement membrane thickening results in the \"wire loop\" appearance sometimes seen by light microscopy.

The examples I have cited typify the problems that arise, but the techniques we have used represent only an infinitesimal fraction of the resources that we must exploit. The main challenge to the bioengineer is that of defining the problem in terms of what is useful and economically justified. One must understand the possibilities of engineering development and the probability that an effort will reach any assignable goal within a given time. Only then is it possible to work out a practical solution to the instrumentation problem. It is very easy to become so absorbed in the engineering development that we lose sight of the final goal and the purpose of the development. It is also easy, in working out an experiment, to become obsessed with the need for a particular bit of data, or of too great a degree of precision, without considering that the cost of obtaining these data might not be justified by their value to the full development. Thus, the only principles that can be generally applied to a bioengineering problem are those which would apply to making any decision that leans heavily on judgment.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","meshMajor":["Biology","Medicine","Science"],"pmid":"13421684","title":"Instrumentation for bioengineering.","year":"1957"},

{"abstractText":"A technique has been developed for collecting large numbers of polymorphonuclear leucocytes from peritoneal exudates in rabbits. These cells are obtained essentially free from other cell types and from debris. When microphages so procured are disrupted by physical methods and extracted with aqueous salt solutions, the soluble fraction manifests striking bactericidal activity, especially on Gram-negative enteric bacilli. The susceptible microorganisms are not lysed. This bactericidal substance, which has been called phagocytin, appears to be limited in distribution mainly to the polymorphonuclear leucocyte. No phagocytin is present in extracts of rabbit heart, kidney, or skeletal muscle, and rabbit liver and spleen contain much less than do packed leucocytes. Extracts of human and of guinea pig microphages show less bactericidal activity than rabbit cell preparations. Similar extracts of rat and mouse polymorphonuclear leucocytes contain no demonstrable phagocytin. As indicated by its behavior on dialysis, on exposure to proteolytic enzymes, and on salt fractionation, phagocytin appears to be a protein with general properties characteristic of a globulin. It is clearly different from lysozyme and from properdin. Although phagocytin is reasonably stable at temperatures of 65 degrees C. and lower for several hours, solutions of it gradually lose bactericidal activity on standing for prolonged periods at 4 degrees C. This instability, and also the ease with which phagocytin is inactivated, presumably by adsorption, on exposure to a variety of materials, have thus far rendered fruitless efforts to isolate it.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Anti-Bacterial Agents","Leukocytes"],"pmid":"13319580","title":"Phagocytin:  a bactericidal substance from polymorphonuclear leucocytes.","year":"1956"},

{"abstractText":"When chick embryo tissues cultivated for 13 days in Hanks's balanced salt solution (BSS) were infected with psittacosis virus (6BC), they did not support active viral multiplication until synthetic medium 199 of Parker (3) was added. By testing various combinations of the substances in this and other synthetic media, it was found that the minimum number of compounds required to effectively stimulate virus growth in the presence of BSS comprised the amino acids and water-soluble vitamins found in medium 199. Addition of either amino acids or water-soluble vitamins alone to BSS resulted in only slight stimulation of viral proliferation. Many constituents of the synthetic media were found not to be essential to the stimulation of viral multiplication. The following substances added to a medium containing amino acids and water-soluble vitamins in BSS failed to increase the quantity of virus produced: diphosphopyridine nucleotide (DPN), triphosphopyridine nucleotide (TPN), coenzyme A, the fat-soluble vitamins, ribose sugars, and three biological reducing agents: cysteine, glutathione, and ascorbic acid. Among other substances that proved to be not essential a group of purines and pyrimidines present in medium 199 were found to be probably toxic to cells in the concentrations used, since virus titers were lower in media containing these compounds than in those from which they were absent. A change in the nutritional status of these cells involving amino acids and water-soluble vitamins has thus permitted to transform a latent, undetectable viral infection to an inactive infection in vitro.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Chlamydophila psittaci","Tissue Culture Techniques"],"pmid":"13319591","title":"Latent viral infection of cells in tissue culture.

{"abstractText":"Certain aspects of the formation of non-infectious hemagglutinins (NIHA) in the chick embryo infected with influenza virus have been analyzed. It was shown by the use of combined in ovo-deembryonation technics that little or no NIHA is released following infection with small doses of standard virus during the most active and constant growth periods of the virus extending to about the 36th hour of incubation in spite of the fact that multiple infection of cells must have taken place in the latter half of that period. A slight decrease in the ID(50)\/HA ratios of the yields obtained after the 36th hour, coinciding with the falling off of virus production and release may possibly be explained in terms of inactivation of completed virus or leakage of as yet incompleted virus from damaged cells. Exposure of the entodermal cells of the allantois of eggs deembryonated shortiy after injection of saturation or near saturation inocula of standard seed to large quantities of infectious virus added to the media at various times after infection and not extending over more than 2 hours resulted in a decrease of the ID(50)\/HA ratios of the progenies only during the first 2 or possibly 4 hours after the primary inoculation. Later addition did not influence the yields. As discussed, such sudden and heavy exposures of cells are not expected to occur during the infectious process induced by small inocula of standard seed. The possible role of destruction of cell receptors in NIHA production has been analyzed in several ways. The addition of receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) to the media of deembryonated eggs after near saturation inocula of standard seeds, if anything, increased the ID(50)\/HA ratios of the progenies, and that only when added during the first few hours following infection, presumably by reducing the changes for high multiplicity of infection of cells. In contrast, ultraviolet-inactivated virus, which retains its enzymatic activity, lowered, if anything, the ID(50)\/HA ratios of the progenies, when present in the media of deembryonated eggs from the 2nd to 4th or possibly 6th hour after infection. Excessive amounts of irradiated virus may still cause some degree of interference under these conditions. Later addition of irradiated viruses were without effect with respect to NIHA production or interference. In attempts to alter the cell receptors prior to infection by potassium periodate (KIO(4)), it was noted that the addition of glycerol led to the appearance and partial retention for at least 24 hours of substances in the allantoic fluids which were capable of inactivating considerable proportions of standard virus. These data indicate that destruction of external cell receptors plays little if any role in NIHA production. The implications of these findings are discussed.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Hemagglutination","Orthomyxoviridae","Tissue Culture Techniques"],"pmid":"13319592","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system.

{"abstractText":"Studies have been reported concerning the relationships between virus materials found in the allantoic membranes and media of eggs deembryonated after injection of Standard (ST), heat-inactivated (37 degrees C.) standard (DeltaST), and undiluted passage (UP) seeds. It was found that the membranes always contained relatively more non-infectious hemagglutinins (NIHA) than the media and, correspondingly, the ratios between infectious virus and hemagglutinin units (ID(50)\/HA) in the tissues were up to 1.5 log(10) units lower than in the liberated progeny. These differences were seen not only following inoculation of undiluted ST, DeltaST, and UP seeds, the progenies of which always contain considerable proportions of NIHA, but also when dilute ST inocula were employed which lead to the liberation of only infectious virus. Essentially similar differences in the ID(50)\/HA ratios were observed also in the allantoic membranes and fluids obtained from growth curve experiments in the intact chick embryo employing the various types of seeds. In correlating the liberated virus materials in the media of deembryonated eggs to those in the membranes it was noted that in any given 2 hour interval during the phase of nearly constant production and release up to 10 times the quantity of infectious virus was shed as was present in the tissues at the onset of that period. In contrast, only about (1\/4) of the hemagglutinins were released during the same time. The viral (V) and soluble (S) complement-fixing antigens were found in the tissues but no detectable quantities were released during any 2 hour interval. The NIHA in the membranes apparently is located within the cells since it could not be released by the action of RDE. Intracellular inhibitors of hemagglutination were readily inactivated following inoculation of undiluted ST, DeltaST, or UP seeds but not when ultraviolet-inactivated virus was used. The inhibitor activity decreased in proportion to the hemagglutinins produced. Transfer of infected deembryonated eggs to the cold room after production and liberation of progeny were well under way immediately halted further release but in the tissues the status quo was maintained and release was resumed on return to the 37 degrees C. incubator. The addition of potassium cyanide to the medium of deembryonated eggs at 37 degrees C. during the period of nearly constant production and release of virus material reduced immediately and to comparable extents the ID(50) and HA titers in the tissues and liberation decreased in proportion. On removal of the cyanide 2 hours later, both titers in the tissues gradually returned to those of the untreated control eggs with a corresponding increase in liberation. The ID(50)\/HA ratios were not affected by these manipulations. It is concluded that the NIHA in the membranes forms part of a dynamic process. An attempt has been made in the discussion to integrate the present results with previous observations concerning the formation of incomplete forms of virus and their nature and role in the infectious process.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Orthomyxoviridae","Tissue Culture Techniques"],"pmid":"13319593","title":"Studies on host-virus interactions in the chick embryo-influenza virus system.

{"abstractText":"Six out of eight epidermal papillomas, induced with tar in mice of homogeneous strain, have grown after transfer to the subcutaneous tissue of sucklings and weanlings. Five of them have been thus maintained for nearly or quite a year and a half, and in seven to nine successive groups of mice. The tumor studied longest has been kept going in five parallel lines since its primary implantation. The papillomas have all grown progressively in most instances, and proved fatal. None has altered except through the occurrence of derivative cancers, but these have arisen so often as only to be excluded on transfer by a rigorous selection of grafts. Histologically the papillomas have been of a single, completely unaggressive kind, yet transfer has disclosed great differences in their abilities. The tumors they form are of unique sorts. The cells of some are able-bodied (Type A), capable of spreading along bare connective tissue and keratinizing like normal, reparative epidermis. They line graft pockets, differentiate into the free space these provide, and form cysts densely packed with keratin. The papilloma is thus turned outside in. The cysts become huge as keratin accumulates in them, and eventually they rupture with result either in subcutaneous dissecting cysts or keratinizing surface growths that are often prodigious in size and fantastic in shape, but sometimes are completely like the cutaneous papillomas ordinarily induced by carcinogens, and tend, when small, to regress or come away as these frequently do. One growth of Type A was placed in the peritoneal cavity or in the liver, spleen or lung, and at all these situations it formed introverted cysts resembling the subcutaneous. The cells of other papillomas are more or less crippled (Type C). In extreme instances they are unable to spread laterally, and produce relatively little keratin. They fail to line graft pockets, but their keratin inflames the exposed connective tissue, extravasation ensues, and a continually enlarging, fluid-filled cyst forms, with walls that are bare except where a stalked or cauliflower papilloma exists, projecting inwards. At last the cyst ruptures and a second dissecting cyst forms, also devoid of papilloma tissue; or else the overlying skin undergoes pressure necrosis, the cyst fluid escapes through a rent, and fatal infection ensues. All gradations exist between Type A and Type C. The cancers derivative from both exhibit a marked disability,-though invasive they are almost or quite unable to extend along bare connective tissue. The papillomas that are possessed of this faculty spread beyond them along the cyst wall, and kill the host through their unceasing activity. In collateral work a papilloma was transplanted that was found protruding from the external auditory canal of a mouse which had received an intramuscular injection of methylcholanthrene many months previously. The tumor is now in its 5th generation, after 15 months. The growths it forms are of Type A. All of the papillomas are functioning tumors, with their own cells as the functioning product. Their papilliferous shape, when on the skin, is due solely to inability of their cells to gain space in other ways. Intrinsically they are keratomas. The papillomas do well after transfer to deep situations because the growth of their cells is indirectly promoted, through favoring local conditions. No direct promotion takes place like that when the cells of prostatic and mammary tumors are stimulated to multiply by hormones. Doubtless many agents act in both ways, that is to say by dual promotion.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Neoplasms, Experimental"],"pmid":"13481256","title":"Fatal keratomas due to deep homografts of the benign papillomas of tarred mouse skin; normal proclivities and neoplastic disabilities as determinants of tumor course.","year":"1958"},

{"abstractText":"The fate of hemolytic staphylococci injected intravenousiy into albino mice was followed by determining quantitatively the numbers of living organisms present in the various tissues at different intervals of time after infection. Irrespective of the strain of staphylococcus used, most of the organisms disappeared rapidly from the blood, liver, spleen, and kidneys. This was true even when the infective dose consisted of large numbers of virulent, coagulase-positive staphylococci, capable of producing a fatal disease in a high percentage of the infected mice. The initial rate of removal or destruction of staphylococci was particularly high in the lungs and kidneys. In all cases on the other hand, a few living staphylococci persisted in the various organs for several weeks after infection, even when the organisms were non-virulent and coagulase-negative. Although virulent as well as avirulent staphylococci were eliminated extremely rapidly and efficiently from the kidneys during the initial stage of infection, the microorganisms soon began to multiply in this organ, causing abscesses first detected in the cortex. Death of the animals infected with virulent cultures appeared to be due to the destruction of renal tissue by these abscesses. The abscesses caused by the avirulent strains eventually became sterile, and healed. No convincing difference could be recognized amongst seven strains in their resistance to the bactericidal power of the mouse tissues during the initial phase of the infection. In contrast, marked quantitative differences came to light in their subsequent behavior in the kidneys. The multiplication of the coagulase-negative staphylococci in this organ soon came to an end in all animals and never proceeded far enough to result in fatal disease. The staphylococci of a weakly coagulase-positive strain multiplied somewhat more extensively in the kidneys than did the coagulase-negative, but never sufficiently to cause the death of any animal within the period of observation of 1 month. The three coagulase-positive strains tested yielded the largest bacterial population in the kidneys and caused the death of many of the infected animals. These three virulent strains differed quantitatively amongst themselves with regard to both the rapidity and extent of their multiplication in the kidneys and the lethal power of a given infective dose. Taken together, the findings indicate that the hemolytic strains of staphylococci can be arranged in a continuous spectrum according to their ability to cause disease in albino mice. Although virulence for these animals appeared to be correlated with the production of coagulase, it did not seem to depend upon the ability of this substance to interfere with the bactericidal mechanisms of the mouse organs during the early phase of the infection. Virulence manifested itself chiefly by the production in the kidneys of progressive abscesses originating from the few staphylococci which were not destroyed during the initial bactericidal reaction.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Micrococcus"],"pmid":"13278457","title":"The behavior of virulent and avirulent staphylococci in the tissues of normal mice.","year":"1956"},

{"abstractText":"Low concentrations of hemoglobin (0.1 microg.\/ml. or less) exert a lethal action on some Gram-negative bacteria under certain conditions in vitro. Hemoglobins from various mammals and the distinct genetic types of human hemoglobin all manifest similar bactericidal activity. The bactericidal effect is a function of the globin moiety of the molecule; native and acid or acid-alcohol denatured globins have the same degree of activity. Hemoglobins kill enterobacteriaceae only under precisely controlled conditions. The test medium must be low in ionic concentration and acid in reaction. Various strains of Escherichia and Salmonella are susceptible to the lethal effect of hemoglobin, while the few strains of Shigella, Klebsiella, and Proteus examined were resistant. Certain acid polysaccharides and basic amines or proteins block the bactericidal effect when incorporated in the test in low concentration. Present evidence also suggests that exposure of the microorganisms to certain cations such as magnesium renders them resistant to the lethal action of globin. Hemoglobin loses its bactericidal power when complexed with haptoglobin, and serum fractions rich in free haptoglobin protect otherwise susceptible bacteria from killing by hemoglobin. The reaction appears to be a bactericidal rather than a bacteriostatic one. At 38 degrees C. maximal killing requires approximately 30 minutes; at temperatures of 28 degrees C. or 0 degrees C. the bactericidal action does not take place. The minimal concentration of hemoglobin required to kill 50 per cent of the microorganisms in the test is unrelated to the size of the bacterial inoculum.

An INH-resistant strain grew about as rapidly as H37Rv. Growth of the pathogenic species occurred at about the same rates in HeLa and monkey kidney cells, but was distinctly slower in human amnion cells, which are less active metabolically.

Cranial injection of the PPLO alone in Swiss and Princeton weanlings was attended by a meagre growth of the organisms in the brain, with no pathologic change. The growth of both catarrhal and conjunctival strains of PPLO in the brains of Swiss mice was greatly enhanced by the simultaneous injection of MHV(C). Rolling was not a characteristic sign prior to autopsy. Brain sections regularly showed a vigorous leukocytic response, commonly accompanied by the destruction of nerve cells in the anterior horns of the cerebrum. Injected in Princeton mice together with the virus, the organisms barely survived and were inactive.

{"abstractText":"Hemosiderin deposits in rats and in man were studied and compared by means of electron and light microscopy. Typical, isotropic, iron-positive hemosiderin granules were found to contain innumerable, closely packed, electron-dense particles, embedded in matter that was much less dense to electrons. Similar dense particles were often scattered diffusely through the cytoplasmic matrix of cells containing hemosiderin granules. In cells of proximal convoluted tubules of rats given repeated intraperitoneal injections of hemoglobin the hemosiderin granules contained dense particles with a mean diameter of 55 A, and with a size-frequency distribution that indicated uniformity. These particles corresponded in size to the iron micelles of ferritin molecules. There was less uniformity of particles in hemosiderin granules situated in liver and reticulo-endothelial cells of rats that had been given a diet containing ethionine. The dense aggregates representing hemosiderin granules were often situated inside discrete cytoplasmic organelles that were bordered by membranes, and sometimes contained \"cristae\"; and often the membranous borders were markedly disrupted. The term \"sidersomes\" is proposed for these specialized cytoplasmic structures which may be derivatives of mitochondria, and apparently play a part in the formation of hemosiderin. Ferritin was crystallized from the livers and kidneys of the hemosiderotic rats with ease, but could not be crystallized from comparable quantities of liver and kidney tissue of untreated control rats. Specimens from the liver and spleen of a patient with advanced hemosiderosis, obtained at an operation, were also studied. In liver and reticulo-endothelial cells many particles with diameters of about 60 A were scattered through the cytoplasmic matrix. By contrast, hemosiderin granules in the same cells contained particles that varied considerably in size. In representative granules, examined at high resolution, the size-frequency distribution of particle diameters displayed a periodicity consistent with the presence of small, uniform subunits. Electron micrographs of ferritin, isolated from the spleen of the same patient, provided confirmation for the inferences that the dense particles observed inside cells are iron micelles, and that ferritin is probably a component of hemosiderin.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Ferritins","Hemosiderosis","Microscopy, Electron","Pigments, Biological"],"pmid":"13449232","title":"A study of hemosiderosis with the aid of electron microscopy; with observations on the relationship between hemosiderin and ferritin.","year":"1957"},

Its molar extinction is 40,000 +\/- 800. Like other rhodopsins, it bleaches to a mixture of opsin and all-trans retinene and is resynthesized by incubating opsin with neo-b (11-cis) retinene. The regenerated rhodopsin has the same lambda(max). as the extracted pigment; this is due, therefore, not to an unusual retinene but to a characteristic human opsin. The regeneration in solution from opsin and neo-b retinene is a second-order reaction with a half-time, at 29.5 degrees C, of about 2.5 minutes. This is much faster than the synthesis of rhodopsin in the living human eye, and faster than human rod dark-adaptation; the rate of both processes in vivo must be limited by reactions which precede the union of neo-b retinene with opsin, the final step in rhodopsin synthesis. In the rods, rhodopsin is virtually in the solid state-highly oriented in close relation with other highly oriented molecules. In this situation its spectrum is displaced toward the red (lambda(max) 500 mmicro) and is narrower than in solution.

{"abstractText":"Two methods for simple and rapid plating of single HeLa cells, human, carcinomatous cells, are described. These result in growth and formation of colonies from each single cell. One of these procedures uses irradiated, non-multiplying \"feeder\" cells to condition the medium. The second requires more gentle handling of the cells, but otherwise is virtually the same as that used in plating bacteria on semisolid, nutrient media. By extension of these methods, it is possible to isolate single mutant colonies and grow pure clonal stocks of animal cells. These genetically uniform strains are much more homogeneous in their behavior than the parental HeLa cell population. Growth curves obtained from developing colonies are highly reproducible. The most active mutant stocks so far isolated display a generation time of 18 to 20 hours. In pooled human serum HeLa cells assume a highly stretched, ameboid form, with marked motility; whereas growth of the same cells in a variety of non-human sera results in tightly packed, columnar, epithelial-like morphology. The two cell types possess volumes, nuclear cross-sections, plating efficiencies, and generation times which are identical within experimental error, but display widely different cross-sectional areas, suggesting that the basic change occurs in the cell surface. It is conceivable that this change may be related to that which enables the cells of a compact tumor to become invasive.

Monocytes and eosinophils are similarly injured, as are polymorphonuclear cells of rabbit and guinea pig blood. The leukotoxic injury is not produced by culture filtrates of leukotoxic cocci nor does it follow phagocytosis of heat-killed cocci. The leukotoxic effect does not appear to be due to action of any presently known streptococcal product. The distribution of leukotoxicity among streptococci is not random, for it was found in all strains tested of certain types of group A (6, 12), and was absent from almost all strains of other types (5, 14, 30). Still other types (3, 4) had both leukotoxic and non-leukotoxic representatives. The injury was also produced by some group C and G strains. Often the streptococci that cause leukocyte death remain alive and proliferate in the cellular debris, but sometimes they are injured by the phagocyte before the latter disintegrates and are unable to proliferate on the slides. The capacity of a strain of streptococcus to injure leukocytes does not necessarily confer virulence on it. This is thought to be because a chain of streptococci, having survived its sojourn in a leukocyte it has killed, is still susceptible to phagocytosis by a fresh leukocyte, and serial phagocytoses may continue until the chain has been exposed sufficiently to the unfavorable intracellular environment to be, itself, killed. Whether leukotoxicity plays a role in naturally occurring streptococcal disease is unknown.

{"abstractText":"Many members of the androstane series profoundly retarded the growth of a transplanted benign mammary fibroadenoma of the rat; the restraint of tumor growth was in direct proportion to the amount of the administered compound until its maximal effect was achieved. Certain steroids closely related to the androstane inhibitors accelerated the growth of the tumor. These effects of divergent sort depend on the molecular structure of the steroid. The molecular structure of androstane derivatives, which is of high significance in modifying the rate of growth of the benign mammary tumor, consists of multiple components. These include (a) the presence and number of ketone and hydroxyl groups in special orientation at specific sites, (b) the sites of dehydrogenation in the molecule, and (c) the presence, number, and state of hydrogenation of alkyl groups at designated molecular positions. These multiple factors determine whether androstane compounds will inhibit growth of the tumor, enhance it, or fail to influence its growth. The androstane compounds which caused either the restraint or the promotion of tumor growth had the common property of inducing proliferation of the normal mammary epithelium. Two mechanisms are involved in the restraint of growth of mammary fibroadenoma by androstane inhibitors. The primary effect is the abolition of action of phenolic estrogens and progesterone when dihydrotestosterone is administered concurrently, presumably through direct action at the tumor cell level A secondary contributory suppressive effect is the depression of ovarian activity, and consequently of the production of phenolic estrogens and progesterone, by these compounds. Transplanted mammary fibroadenoma in the rat possesses neoplastic traits and also some growth properties of normal mammary epithelium; inhibition of these latter by hormonal methods commonly retarded the growth of the tumor.

Alteration of the chromatin pattern of the nucleus, and Type B acidophilic intranuclear inclusions, were seen as early as 4 hours after virus inoculation. Later wrinkling and shrivelling of the nucleus occurred, and eosinophilic cytoplasmic masses appeared. The rounded, pycnotic cell, customarily used as an index of the cytopathic response, was found only during the last stages of the infective process. On the basis of these changes, infected cells could be classified into six different types. Differential cell counts were made on the stained cultures, and the stage of cytopathic degeneration was correlated with the appearance of virus in the cells and in the culture fluid.

It was demonstrated by means of H.I., complement-fixation and in ovo-neutralization tests that the variants exhibited a progressively decreasing reactivity with the parent PR8-S antiserum while retaining the ability to elicit antibody to PR8-S influenza virus and to their respective predecessors. Accompanying these changes was a progressive reduction in antigenicity without any significant changes in pathogenicity for mice. Experimental evidence was presented which indicates that the serological changes observed with the variants are not related to the P-Q phenomenon. Antibody absorption tests showed that the variants share antigens with PR8-S virus but differ from it by the presence of specific antigenic components; these increase in quantity with each successive variant while the amount of related antigens shows a progressive decrease. The importance of evaluating the significance of antigenic changes of influenza viruses with active immunity tests was emphasized by the fact that PR8-S vaccine protected mice against fatal infection with lethal doses of the variant strains although the latter had a progressively decreasing serological reactivity with PR8-S antiserum. The inheritable character of the new antigenic properties of the variant strains was demonstrated by their persistence in the absence of thea selective environment following 18 to 24 serial intranasal passages with large inocula in normal mice and following limiting dilution passage in fertile eggs.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Antibodies","Antigens","Orthomyxoviridae"],"pmid":"13306851","title":"Antigenic variants of influenza A virus (PR8 strain).

{"abstractText":"The nature of the fluid draining from the kidney, after its artery was occluded, was investigated. Samples of systemic arterial blood, renal venous blood and urine were also analyzed. It was found that the fluid draining from the kidney after occlusion is a mixture of vascular blood and another fluid designated as \"diluting fluid,\" each contributing half to the composite mixture. In volume the mixture is 26 per cent of the functionally distended kidney. With the assumption that the renal extracellular fluid can be considered a simple mixture of blood plasma and a cell-free fluid, the composition of the \"diluting fluid\" was deduced from the known compositions of vascular blood and total fluid draining. The ratios of its content in a given substance to that in systemic (or renal venous) plasma are: for Na and Ca, 1.0; K, 1.5; Cl, 1.2; PO(4), 2.0; urea, 1.8; plasma protein, 0.3; albumin, 0.4; glucose, 0.4, and osmolarity, 1.2. The fluid bears little or no relation to urine, especially since the urine varied considerably between individual dogs whereas the \"diluting fluid\" was relatively constant in composition. It was also found that the hematocrit of the fluid draining after arterial occlusion progressively decreased as it flowed out, until the last portion contained only 5 per cent red cells. It is concluded that since renal lymph has approximately the same composition in protein, urea, glucose, and inulin as does \"diluting fluid,\" the latter is, in all probability, renal interstitial fluid. Under the conditions of the experiment, it drains out of the kidney slowly relative to blood drainage. It is large in volume, particularly when compared with the capillaries that nourish it.

{"abstractText":"As a basis for studies on the interaction of phagocytes and tubercle bacilli experiments were carried out to obtain information on some biochemical characteristics of exudate leucocytes from guinea pigs. It was found that total cellular phosphorus was the most suitable measure of protoplasm. Cell counts were less reliable because of unavoidable clumping in the suspension, and dry weight measurements were less specific when contamination with erythrocytes occurred. The utility of phosphorus measurements in this connection depends upon the fact that an erythrocyte contains only 4 per cent of the phosphorus present in a leucocyte. From measurements on mixed suspensions consisting of varying known proportions of polymorphonuclear and mononuclear leucocytes as determined by differential counting, it was possible to compute true values for these two cell types with respect to oxygen consumption and lactic acid production. Thus it was found that monocytes consumed considerably more oxygen and produced more lactate than polymorphonuclear leucocytes. From the data obtained it is suggested that differences in metabolic activity found when comparing cell suspensions obtained by the use of different irritants are due to different proportions of the two cell types. In particular, the effects of oxygen tension and pH on the activities of the cells were studied. It was found that decreasing the proportion of oxygen in the atmosphere from that of air to 1 per cent reduced oxygen consumption by about 80 per cent, whereas lactic acid production was increased by about 45 per cent. It was also found that decreasing the pH of the medium below pH 7.5 caused a considerable reduction in the respiration, lactate production, and viability of polymorphonuclear leucocytes. The monocytes proved less sensitive to similar changes in pH, especially with regard to lactic acid production and viability. Observations were made of oxygen consumption and lactate production during phagocytosis. During the hour following the addition of heat-killed tubercle bacilli to the phagocytes, the oxygen consumption of suspensions rich in polymorphonuclear leucocytes rose by 60 per cent, and that of suspensions rich in monocytes rose by nearly 100 per cent.

{"abstractText":"The intravenous injection of bacterial endotoxins alter the coagulation system of rabbits' blood in vivo. Twenty-four hours after the first injection the fibrinogen level rises to twice normal values. The second injection at this time causes a 30 to 40 per cent decrease in fibrinogen content in 4 hours. Twenty hours later it again rises to twice normal values. A marked decrease in whole blood coagulation times in silicone occurs 4 hours after both injections but rises to normal values 24 hours following each injection. The circulating platelets drop from average levels of 300,000\/c.mm. to 150,000\/c.mm. after the first injection. The platelets remain at this low level and decrease to less than 100,000 after the second injection. During this time no fibrinolytic or fibrinogenolytic activity can be detected. Also, there is no significant change in the one stage prothrombin times or antithrombin titres. The marked decrease in circulating fibrinogen at the time when intracapillary thrombi are formed suggests that the \"hyaline\" thrombi of the generalized Shwartzman reaction are composed, in part, of fibrin.

The higher the preinjection fibrinogen level, the more extensive is the thrombosis.

After washing, the tissues either were extracted at once or planted and the fluids and tissues harvested 1 to 3 days later. Antibody was determined by a modification of the Boyden hemagglutination technique. Small amounts of antibody were synthesized as early as 1 hour after the addition of antigen. The antibody formed could be specifically inhibited with BGG, was not dialyzable, and did not sediment at 105,000 g for 2 hours. Dose-response studies revealed no antibody formation when the BGG concentration was 0.005 or 0.05 mg.\/ml. The best responses were obtained at concentrations of 0.5 to 5.0 mg.\/ml. These results were found irrespective of whether the animal had previously received BGG in vivo. Forty per cent autologous serum increased antibody formation about 9-fold over that secured with protein-free medium or with 40 per cent homologous serum. Antibody formed with this system could be detected by 50 per cent complement fixation test, although at much lower titer than found by hemagglutination. While spleens from rabbits previously given BGG did not produce more antibody than spleens from normal rabbits, they differed in that they produced antibody without the involvement of endotoxin.

The reactions appeared to depend on formation of types of antibody-quinidine-platelet complexes which could fix complement but complement was not necessary for these reactions. Complement fixation was at least 10 times more sensitive than platelet agglutination or inhibition of clot retraction for measurement and detection of antibody activity. Although it has been considered that antibodies of drug purpura act as platelet lysins in the presence of complement and that direct lysis of platelets accounts for development of thrombocytopenia in drug purpura, the present study suggests that attachment of antibody produces a change in platelets which is manifested in vitro only by increased susceptibility to non-specific factors which can alter the stability of platelets in the absence of antibody. The attachment of antibody to platelets in vivo may only indirectly affect platelet survival. In contrast to human platelets, dog, rabbit, and guinea pig platelets, and normal or trypsin-treated human red cells did not agglutinate, fix complement, or adsorb antibody; and intact human endothelial cells did not fix complement or adsorb antibody. Rhesus monkey platelets were not agglutinated by the antibody but did adsorb antibody and fix complement although their activity in these reactions differed quantitatively from that of human platelets.

{"abstractText":"It is important to find answers to two questions concerning the visual discriminations of dichromatic persons, especially deuteranopes: (i) Do such persons show a loss of sensitivity to various wavelengths of the spectrum as compared with normal subjects? (ii) What colors do they see? A number of experiments were performed on the first question. First, luminosity curves were determined on three groups of subjects, consisting respectively of five protanopes, six deuteranopes, and seven normal individuals. As compared with normal subjects, protanopes show a loss of luminosity in the red, whereas deuteranopes show a loss in the blue-to-green region of the spectrum (See 10). Second, we examined the luminosity curves of a subject whose right eye is classifiable (on the basis of color-mixture determinations) as normal and whose left eye is classifiable as dichromatic. (The hue discrimination curve for her dichromatic eye seemed comparable to the curve of the usual deuteranope except in the violet, where it manifested relatively good discrimination.) The luminosity function for this subject's dichromatic eye, determined by data on threshold and flicker, exhibits the same type of luminosity loss in the blue and green regions of the spectrum as was shown by our group of six deuteranopes. Only unilaterally dichromatic subjects can tell us how colors seen by a dichromatic eye appear to a normal eye. In the color-blind eye, our unilaterally dichromatic subject sees wavelengths below and above her neutral (\"grey\") point (which occurs at 502 mmicro) as, respectively, a blue equivalent to about 470 mmicro and a yellow equivalent to about 570 mmicro in her normal eye. The results on (i) luminosity loss and (ii) the seeing of wavelengths above 502 mmicro as yellow are considered theoretically. The seeing of yellow by deuteranopes and protanopes may be accounted for by an idea based on Leber-Fick transmation theory. It is proposed that the characteristic sensitivities of the red and green receptors become similar while no change takes place in their central brain connections. Losses may be introduced into the transformed sensitivity curves to indicate appropriate degrees of luminosity deficit for deuteranopes and protanopes.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","meshMajor":["Color Perception"],"pmid":"13529033","title":"Color defect and color theory; studies of normal and colorblind persons, including a subject color-blind in one eye but not in the other.","year":"1958"},

Strains that produced relatively large plaques, up to 6 mm. in diameter, on a monkey stable (MS) cell line, were classified as MS(+).

Attenuated strains appeared deficient in this gene, for they produced tiny plaques less than 1 mm. in size, or no visible plaques at all; they were considered as MS mutants. Strains of maximum neurovirulence for the monkey possessed the MS(+) and d(+) characters, while those of greatest attenuation were MS d. Strains possessing the MS d(+) character showed high or intermediate attenuation. Virulent strains grew equally well in MS or primary monkey kidney (MK) cells. Attenuated strains gave lower titers in MS cultures than in MK cultures. While MS cells after infection with a virulent virus yielded about 100 to 200 PFU per cell, only one PFU per MS cell was detected after infection with an attenuated virus. A study of newly isolated Type 3 strains showed them to consist of the MS(+)d(+) or MS d(+) type. The MS(+)d(+) virus proved to be highly paralytogenic for monkeys even by the intramuscular route, while the MS d(+) virus was of the partially attenuated type.

By virtue of this difference one can trace the intracellular transformation of colloidal iron, administered parenterally, into ferritin and hemosiderin. One hour after intraperitoneal injection of iron-dextran or saccharated iron oxide into mice, characteristic deposits were present in splenic macrophages, in sinusoidal endothelial cells of spleen and liver, and in vascular endothelial cells of various renal capillaries. Four hours after injection, small numbers of ferritin molecules were identifiable about intracellular aggregates of injected iron compounds; and by the 6th day, ferritin was abundant in close proximity to deposits of injected iron compounds. The latter were frequently situated in cytoplasmic vesicles delimited by single membranes. These vesicles were most frequently found in tissue obtained during the first 6 days after injection; and in certain of the vesicles ferritin molecules surrounded closely packed aggregates of injected material. Much unchanged ferric hydroxide was still present in macrophages and vascular endothelial cells 3 to 4 weeks after injection. While electron microscopy left no doubt about the identity of injected ferric hydroxide on the one hand, and of ferritin or hemosiderin on the other, histochemical tests for iron failed in this respect. Precipitation of ferric hydroxide (hydrous ferric oxide) from stabilized colloidal dispersions of iron-dextran was brought about in vitro by incubation with minced mouse tissue (e.g. liver), but not by incubation with mouse serum or blood. Subcutaneous injections of hydrous gel of ferric oxide into mice initially produced localized extracellular precipitates. Most of the material was still extracellular 16 days after injection, though part of it was phagocytized by macrophages near the site of injection; but apparently none reached the spleen in unaltered form. Five days after injection and thereafter, much ferritin was present in macrophages about the site of injection and in the spleen. The findings show that iron preparations widely used in therapy can be identified within cells, and that their intracellular disposition and fate can be followed at the molecular level. Considered in the light of previous work, they indicate that the characteristic structure of the ferric hydroxide micelles in molecules of ferritin is specific, and develops during the union of apoferritin with ferric hydroxide. Apparently this union does not depend upon specific cell components.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Ferritins","Iron","Microscopy, Electron","Pigments, Biological"],"pmid":"13620849","title":"The cellular transformation of injected colloidal iron complexes into ferritin and hemosiderin in experimental animals; a study with the aid of electron microscopy.","year":"1959"},

{"abstractText":"Chylomicrons were separated by low and high speed ultracentrifugation from lipemic sera of human subjects in the absorptive phase. The final chylomicron preparation was free from other serum components and contained a small constant amount of protein, approximately 2 per cent of the chylomicron fraction. Electrophoresis, immunochemical analysis, and absorption experiments identified the protein component as derived from a mixture of beta and alpha(1) serum lipoproteins. Large aliquots of an emulsion of serum freed of chylomicrons and coconut oil were incubated at 37 degrees C. for 2 hours and ultracentrifuged as in the preparation of chylomicrons. The fat particles now showed the presence of minute amounts of beta and alpha(1) serum lipoproteins in almost the same proportion as found in chylomicrons. \"Finger prints\" of delipidized samples of chylomicrons and particles from serum-coconut oil emulsion gave similar, although not identical patterns. The data on \"clearing factor\" activity corroborated the finding that serum alpha(1) lipoproteins are contained in chylomicrons and particles from serum-coconut oil emulsion. These two lipide particles, partially delipidized, were both able to activate a \"clearing factor\" system in vitro, a property exhibited only by intact or partially delipidized alpha(1) serum lipoproteins. Clearing activity was satisfactorily determined by using an emulsion of coconut oil mixed in agar as a substrate to give an opaque gel, in which the diffusing enzyme showed its activity by areas of clearing. The results obtained by this technique were in agreement with those based on fall in optical density and non-esterified fatty acid production. Chemical analysis of serum chylomicrons showed a concentration of cholesterol and phospholipides higher than could be accounted for by the attached beta and alpha(1) serum lipoproteins. On the basis of these results the assumption is made that in the blood stream small amounts of serum lipoproteins, by a process of adsorption, form a complex with the absorbed triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipides, to produce chylomicrons.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Fats"],"pmid":"13620852","title":"Separation and characterization of human serum chylomicrons.","year":"1959"},

{"abstractText":"A methodology has been described for reliable cultivation in vitro of dispersed fibroblastic cells obtained from normal human organs. The procedure has permitted establishment of stable cell lines from almost every sample taken, among which the following organs were represented: skin, spleen, amnion, lung, liver, bone marrow, brain, muscle, and heart. Equally good growth has been achieved with cells from embryonic or adult tissues. The methods previously developed whereby single cells plated in Petri dishes grow into isolated macroscopic colonies can successfully be applied to the plating of human fibroblastic stocks. Plating efficiencies in the neighborhood of 50 to 60 per cent are readily achieved with such strains. The resulting colonies can be picked and clonal stocks established. Fibroblastic morphology is maintained in the colonies arising from every single cell of such clonal stocks. All of the single cells from epithelioid clonal strains also maintain their integrity throughout repeated subculture. Since the difference between clonal stocks of these two types is always maintained whenever the respective single cells are plated in the same medium, regardless of the previous history of these stocks, it may be concluded that a true genetic difference exists in these cell lines. In addition to the morphological differences between epithelioid and fibroblastic cell strains, the latter have more demanding nutritional requirements for single cell growth. Thus, single cells of fibroblastic lines almost never produce colonies with high efficiency unless the growth medium which is sufficient for epithelioid cells is supplemented with embryo extract, or a cell feeder layer. Fibroblastic cells are also more resistant to tryptic digestion of the bond uniting the cells to glass surfaces. By use of differential media, growth of both fibroblastic and epithelioid cells, respectively, has been obtained, from dispersed single cells obtained by trypsinization of a specimen of human embryonic lung.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Tissue Culture Techniques"],"pmid":"13439121","title":"Clonal growth in vitro of human cells with fibroblastic morphology; comparison of growth and genetic characteristics of single epithelioid and fibroblast-like cells from a variety of human organs.","year":"1957"},

{"abstractText":"The \"delayed hypersensitive\" reactivity induced by antigen-antibody complexes has been studied from the standpoints of the role of such complexes in establishing this state, and the relationship of this state to classical delayed hypersensitivity. It has been shown that the reactivity established by antigen-antibody complexes appears early after injection, disappears within a few days, and is characterized by several properties which make it appear similar to true delayed hypersensitivity, including its appearance, its relative persistence for 48 hours, and its occurrence in the absence of antibodies. By the same tokens, it may be distinguished from hypersensitive reactions of the immediate type. It is referred to here as reactivity of the Jones-Mote type. Antigen alone stimulates exactly the same kind of early reactive state, but with larger doses of antigen this is later replaced by other immunologic responses including circulating antibodies and Arthus reactivity. If sufficiently small doses of antigen are employed, however, the \"monophasic\" reaction which follows antigen-antibody complexes consisting of the Jones-Mote type of skin responsiveness may be seen. The dermal reactivity under discussion is unlike classical delayed hypersensitivity chiefly in its evanescent character; it is present only during a few days early after antigen administration. It is suggested that this kind of reactivity, which may perhaps require a category of its own, may be related to the \"tissue immunity\" to tumor transplants which has been observed in mice.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Antigen-Antibody Reactions"],"pmid":"13598815","title":"The delayed hypersensitivity induced by antigen-antibody complexes.","year":"1958"},

Infectious material could not be demonstrated in the fluid phase of infected cultures and inocula for passage therefore consisted of suspensions of infected tissue. Such tissue suspensions when stored in the frozen state did not regularly retain infectivity. The cytopathic process was focal and appeared to develop as the result of transfer of infectious material from cell to contiguous cell. Optimum development of the focal lesions in vitro related directly to conditions favoring optimum tissue growth and was further influenced by the spatial relationship of the tissue outgrowth. A variety of types of cells of human origin and several of monkey origin were susceptible to infection and responded with the formation of intranuclear inclusion bodies. The cellular response otherwise was variable, ranging from simple rounding with little change in size to the formation of large multinucleated cytoplasmic syncytia.

{"abstractText":"The preparation of antigenic materials capable of specific fixation of complement in the presence of convalescent phase sera from patients with varicella and herpes zoster is described. Satisfactory antigens were obtained by the repetitive harvest and subsequent concentration of the pooled nutrient fluids from bottle cultures of human embryonic skin-muscle tissue or of monkey kidney tissue infected with varicella or herpes zoster viruses. Specific fixation of complement was also demonstrated with antigens prepared from extracts of the infected cell sheets harvested from bottle cultures. In individuals with varicella, complement-fixing antibody usually appeared in the serum 4 or 5 days after the development of the exanthem and further significant increases in titer were characteristically observed during the 2nd week of illness. The complement-fixing antibody response in herpes zoster tended to follow the same pattern as in varicella, with the exception that in sera from some individuals relatively high titers were present in the acute phase specimen. Complement-fixing antigens prepared from varicella strains or from a zoster strain reacted to essentially the same degree with convalescent sera from the homologous and the heterologous clinical entities. The varicella-zoster antigens did not fix complement in the presence of paired sera obtained from a limited number of individuals with primary infections due to herpes simplex virus or from individuals with generalized vaccinia infection. Specific inhibition in vitro of the focal cytopathic process produced by the varicella-zoster viruses was demonstrated. This was accomplished by the incorporation of the sera under test as constituents of nutrient media of the cultures, either prior to or at the time of their inoculation with virus. The neutralization of focal cytopathogenicity thus obtained was relative in degree and never absolute; it was therefore assayed by repetitive counts of the number of focal lesions per culture in the various test groups. Inhibition of varicella-zoster viral cytopathogenicity occurred in the presence of convalescent serum from either clinical entity. The results of the immunologic studies with the viruses of herpes zoster and varicella as propagated in vitro are considered as providing further evidence in support of the concept of the close relationship and probable identity of the two agents.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Herpesvirus 3, Human"],"pmid":"13598817","title":"The etiologic agents of varicella and herpes zoster; serologic studies with the viruses as propagated in vitro.","year":"1958"},

{"abstractText":"The arginine-rich fraction of calf thymus histone (histone B) exerts bactericidal activity on various coliform bacilli and micrococci under certain conditions in vitro. Final concentrations of less than 1 microg. histone per ml. kill susceptible microbes without detectable morphological alteration or lysis. Among the microorganisms highly susceptible to histone are Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, and Micrococcus pyogenes var. albus. Less susceptible or completely resistant are Proteus, Serratia, Micrococcus pyogenes var. aureus, and various types of hemolytic streptococci. Coliforms grown on solid media are much more resistant to the lethal effect of histone than are those cultured in liquid media. This difference is apparently related to the physiological state of the bacteria; agar grown microorganisms washed with water remain resistant to histone, whereas incubation in broth rapidly renders them more susceptible. Histone is adsorbed onto heat-killed E. coli K-12 under conditions suitable for lethal action on this organism. The bactericidal activity of histone is but little affected by pH of the test system, but ionic strength of the medium exerts a marked influence, the lethal action being reduced or blocked as the salt concentration reaches levels higher than that of 0.15-0.2 M NaCl. Relatively high concentrations of rabbit serum or of bovine plasma albumin reduce the bactericidal activity of histone in a medium at pH 7; these serum preparations are, however, essentially without effect in the test system at pH 5.6. The bactericidal effect of histone is antagonized by addition to the medium of small amounts of certain basic substances (protamine, spermine), or of various acid polysaccharides (heparin, nucleic acid, bacterial lipopolysaccharides). The rate of killing of E. coli K-12 by histone increases as the temperature and the concentration of histone are raised. Within the limits studied, this rate also appears to be directly proportional to the concentration of bacteria in the system.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Bacteria","Histones"],"pmid":"13598820","title":"Bactericidal action of histone.","year":"1958"},

A single intraperitoneal injection at birth of 10 to 100 mg. BSA, HGG, ovalbumin, or a human macroglobulin, or an oral feeding of 100 mg. BSA, induced a state of unresponsiveness lasting at least 90 to 120 days. 100 mg. BSA given from birth to 17 days of age, but not later, produced unresponsiveness of 90 to 120 days' duration. Data are presented which show that the duration of unresponsiveness is finite and related to the amount of antigen given at birth, and that it may be indefinitely prolonged by repeated injections of antigen. Disappearance of injected antigen in the unresponsive animal was exponential with time, with no accelerated or immune phase. Administration of the antigen in adjuvants resulted in significant shortening of the duration of unresponsiveness. The transfer of immune cells to the unresponsive host while resulting in vicarious antibody formation, did not affect the underlying unresponsive state. Negative results of attempts to produce unresponsiveness to a variety of bacterial antigens are presented. The implications of the data are discussed, particularly in reference to the other experimental models of immunological tolerance, and to the various theories of acquired immunity.

{"abstractText":"My conclusions, which, I confess, are tentative and based mainly on studies of one kind of cell, the grasshopper neuroblast, may be summarized as follows. The late prophase orientation of the chromosomes is a carry-over from the late telophase orientation. It is apparently maintained by means of the centromeres, which appear to be attached within a limited region of the nucleus throughout telophase, interphase, and prophase. Metaphase orientation of the chromosomes may be explained as the resultant of two forces: a force involving the centromere and spindle, which is responsible for keeping the centromeres in the equatorial plane of the spindle, and a repulsion force involving the noncentromeric portion of the chromosomes, which results in a tendency toward uniform spacing of the chromosomes outside the spindle. Anaphase separation of sister chromatids and their subsequent movement toward the poles of the spindle involves at least four distinct phases: (i) the initial poleward movement of the centromeres, which may be due to intrinsic repulsion or to a force acting between spindle and centromeres that produces an angle of almost 90 degrees between the separated and unseparated portions of the chromatids; (ii) the autonomous separation of the noncentromeric part of the chromosome; (iii) elongation of the spindle, beginning just after the sister chromatids are separated proximally and ending when the longer chromatids are about to lose contact distally; and (iv) the later movement apart of the daughter chromosomes, probably resulting from a pushing force exerted by elongation of the interzonal fibers.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","meshMajor":["Cell Division","Chromosomes"],"pmid":"13351623","title":"On the mitotic movements of chromosomes.","year":"1956"},

{"abstractText":"The principle of animal population control through the use of sexually sterile males has been demonstrated for insects. Sexually sterile males that retain their sexual vigor and behavior will exert greater influence in regulating animal populations than can be achieved by destroying or removing the same number of individuals from the population. This hypothesis is supported by calculations showing theoretical population trends in assumed insect and animal populations subjected to treatments that destroy or eliminate certain percentages of the individuals as compared with a procedure that retains or replaces the same number of males in the population after sterilization. The maximum regulating effect that can be achieved is in direct proportion to the ratio of sterile to fertile males competing for mates. The advantages of inducing sexual sterility in a natural population of an insect species by chemical or other treatment over the method of rearing and releasing a dominating population of sterile males are considered. It is suggested that the sterile-male method may have practical application for undesirable populations of certain wild animals as well as for insects.","journal":"Science (New York, N.Y.)","meshMajor":["Infertility"],"pmid":"14410136","title":"Sterile-male method of population control.","year":"1959"},

This was accomplished by interrupted feeding, feeding after an interval of several days from the infective meal, or by application of a suspension of the mouthparts of the insects either immediately after their infective meal or several days later. Insect transmission was also successful from the satellite growths resulting from subcutaneous extensions of the typical papillomas of infected cottontails, and from certain peculiar, subcutaneous nodules, arising rapidly after infection, and not heretofore described.

{"abstractText":"The transfer to rabbits of homologous lymph node cells which have been incubated in vitro with Shigella-trypsin filtrate leads to the appearance of agglutinins to Shigella in the sera of the recipients. In the present study it has been found that the prior injection of the prospective recipients with blood leucocytes from the donor animals prevented the appearance of anti-Shigella agglutinins. The following observations have been made in this system: 1. The degree of the pre-injection effect was found to be a function of the number of leucocytes injected and of the interval between such pre-injection and the transfer of the antigen-incubated lymph node cells. 2. The pre-injection of leucocytes at appropriate intervals could also cause the failure of antibody to appear in sera of recipients of lymph node cells when these were obtained from donor rabbits injected with Shigella, 1, 2, or 3 days prior to cell transfer. 3. Agglutinins failed to appear in cell-transfer experiments after the pre-injection not only of blood leucocytes, but also of lymph node cells, peritoneal exudate cells, or thymus cells of rabbits. This effect was not brought about by pre-injection of erythrocytes of rabbits or leucocytes of chicken, cow, or horse. The pre-injection of leucocytes of human blood had an effect of partial suppression. 4. When the leucocytes for pre-injection were pooled from groups of rabbits, either the prospective donors of the lymph node cells or other rabbits, essentially complete suppression of agglutinin titers occurred regularly. When the leucocytes for pre-injection were obtained from an individual rabbit and the lymph node cells from another rabbit the suppression of the recipients' titers occurred sporadically. 5. When the recipient's own leucocytes were pre-injected the subsequent agglutinin titers were somewhat lower than those of the non-pre-injected controls. When the recipient's whole blood was re-injected as the source of leucocytes the subsequent agglutinin titers were as high as those of the non-pre-injected controls. 6. The pre-injection effect was not obtained if the leucocytes had been heated, frozen and thawed, suspended in distilled water, lyophilized, or treated with sodium iodoacetate. However, sonic oscillation or x-irradiation of the leucocytes had no effect on their capacity to bring about the pre-injection effect.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Agglutination"],"pmid":"13549639","title":"Studies on the transfer of lymph node cells.

Precipitating antibodies to ragweed pollen extract produced in experimental animals can be demonstrated in dilutions as high as 10(5) to 10(7), while antibodies to ragweed in allergic sera are detected only in dilutions of the order of 10(3).

{"abstractText":"The effect of highly purified rheumatoid factor on the precipitin reactions of various antigen-antibody systems was determined. The amount of nitrogen precipitated was increased over a broad range when the factor was added to ovalbumin, human albumin, or human gamma globulin, and the corresponding rabbit antibodies. In the zone of antigen excess, soluble antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated by rheumatoid factor. Soluble aggregates of human and rabbit gamma globulin, produced by heating at 63 degrees C., treatment with urea plus mercaptoethanol or treatment with guanidine, also precipitated with rheumatoid factor. Ultracentrifugal analysis of dissolved specific precipitates showed the presence of aggregated gamma globulin. The sedimentation rate of reactive aggregates was greater than 20 S, and concentrated preparations free of the non-reactive 7 S gamma globulin could be prepared by various procedures of zone centrifugation. These aggregates showed a high inhibitory capacity in the sensitized sheep cell agglutination reaction. Solid gamma globulin, prepared by heat denaturation, also selectively adsorbed the rheumatoid factor, and removed or decreased the activity in the various precipitation and agglutination reactions. Elution of highly purified active preparations from the solid gamma globulin could be carried out with urea or acid buffers. Evidence for interaction between rheumatoid factor and low molecular weight gamma globulin without precipitation, was also obtained. This interaction appears to occur in the circulation of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The question of whether the rheumatoid factor represents an antibody to gamma globulin was discussed. Points of similarity to the behavior of complement also were cited.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Antigen-Antibody Reactions","Arthritis, Rheumatoid","gamma-Globulins"],"pmid":"13549644","title":"Interaction of the rheumatoid factor with antigen-antibody complexes and aggregated gamma globulin.","year":"1958"},
{"abstractText":"The material in gamma globulin (\"reactant\") which reacts with rheumatoid sera in the F II precipitin and F II tanned sheep cell agglutination tests was concentrated by precipitation with sodium sulfate. The concentrated \"reactant\" appeared to consist of polydispersed molecular aggregates of gamma globulin with s(20) constants as high as 40, as well as the previously described inhomogeneous aggregated material. Aggregated gamma globulin precipitated readily with most rheumatoid sera regardless of the reaction volume, and in low concentration inhibited the F II tanned sheep cell agglutination reaction and sensitized tanned erythrocytes to the agglutinating action of a positive rheumatoid serum. On the other hand, non-aggregated gamma globulin (7S) did not precipitate with rheumatoid sera and in low concentration did not inhibit the F II tanned sheep cell agglutination reaction, or sensitize tanned erythrocytes. Non-aggregated gamma globulin in large excess inhibited the precipitin reaction of aggregated gamma globulin with \"rheumatoid factor,\" and accounted for the characteristic shape of the whole F II precipitin curves and the volume effect described by Vaughan (relation of increased precipitate yield relative to the reaction volume in whole F II precipitin studies). In serological systems other than the F II tanned sheep cell and F II precipitin reactions, the sensitization involves an antigen-antibody combination; i.e., sheep erythrocyte plus hemolysin in the sensitized sheep cell test, and egg albumin plus anti egg albumin in the absorption experiments with specific precipitates. The aggregation of gamma globulin that was essential for sensitization in the F II tanned sheep cell and F II precipitin tests may have simulated the aggregation of antibody gamma globulin that occurs with antigen-antibody union.

There is thus drawn to a close an investigation that was initiated many years ago in Berlin in the Imperial Institute of Physics (9). The second result is the establishment of a general physical mechanism of photosynthesis, involving an interplay between light energy and respiratory energy, and therewith the solution of the quantum problem in photosynthesis. The third result is the establishment of the function of chlorophyll as a stoichiometric, chemically reacting component in photosynthesis. There remains the special chemistry of photosynthesis. In this still-unfinished field of investigation, the latest discovery is the labile carbon dioxide of Chlorella, connected with the decomposition and resynthesis of glutamic acid in living Chlorella, and connected with the possible function of the amino acids, aspartic and glutamic, in the binding and reduction of carbonic acid. The dissociating CO(2) is bound by Chlorella only in the presence of O(2) and of cellular glutamic acid. This CO(2) is released if the oxygen pressure is lowered below 2 mm of water or if-in the presence of oxygen-the glutamic acid is split in the living Chlorella, for example, by N\/10,000 benzoquinone.

Germany still has several years to go before the effects of the war will be obliterated. In most northern European countries, the organization and support of academic research ranges from good to excellent, and a stimulating intellectual atmosphere exists. Germany is rapidly contending for the lead in basic research along with England and Sweden, which are now in the forefront. The Netherlands is typified by superb organization, and most of the Scandinavian countries are high in quality if not always in quantity of research. France is characterized by brilliant individual contributions but over-all falls far short of her potential for scientific research. Switzerland, a highly industrialized country, is geared primarily for engineering and does not compete as highly on basic research as might otherwise be expected. Italian research is good in certain areas but is plagued by a number of difficulties that retard progress. Nevertheless, there are encouraging efforts being made in Italy to develop some good scientific programs. In the south of Europe the situation is generally discouraging and will continue to be so, except where a few dedicated, brilliant individuals are making good contributions with the meager resources available. Europe will continue to be a tremendous scientific manpower reserve for the United States, and, despite accusations of proselyting, the fact remains that in many European countries the employment possibilities are not commensurate with the production rate of scientists and engineers. If the universities of Europe would realign the professional structure of their departmental staffs and extend their graduate curricula they would give far more opportunity to young research scientists and make better use of their facilities.

Hybrids of the remated strain appeared at high frequency on the plates containing L-arabinose, and could be detected at lower frequencies on plates containing D-xylose, L-rhamnose, and L-fucose. Those selected for D-xylose or L-rhamnose utilization possessed the attributes of segregating diploid heterozygotes being highly unstable and continually segregating a cultural form typical of the S. typhosa parent. The unstable type exhibited most of the biochemical characteristics of the E. coli parent including the ability to produce indol, and also reacted with antiserum to both the E. coli and S. typhosa parent strains, owing to the acquisition of a thermolabile antigen from the E. coli parent. The parent and hybrid strains were examined in detail for changes in patterns of phage susceptibility and virulence.

{"abstractText":"Studies on the pathogenesis of rabies in two species of experimentally infected insectivorous Chiroptera, the Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida mexicana), a quasi hibernator, and the little brown bat (Myotis lucifugus), a deep hibernator, provided evidence that brown adipose tissue may serve as an extraneural site for storage and multiplication of rabies virus. Although the Mexican free-tailed bat proved to be relatively insusceptible to experimental rabies infection, virus was demonstrated in the brown fat of 22 per cent of those animals shown to be infected by viral assay in white Swiss mice. Rabies infection in this species was most evident 20 to 40 days after intramuscular inoculation of virus. Rabies virus was found to be widely distributed in the little brown myotis 9 to 26 days following inoculation and virus concentrations in some of the tissues approached the level of the stock mouse brain virus suspension used in inoculating these bats. The shorter incubation period and higher virus titers in the tissues assayed reflect the increased susceptibility of Myotis lucifugus as compared with the Mexican free-tailed bat. Virus was demonstrated in the brown fat of 30 per cent of the experimentally infected Myotis. In the experimentally infected Myotis lucifugus and in the Syrian hamster which is highly susceptible to rabies infection, rabies virus was isolated more frequently from the brown fat than from the salivary gland indicating that in a susceptible host brown adipose tissue may be as frequent a site of viral proliferation as salivary gland. Since rabies virus was found to persist for long periods of time in the brown fat of experimentally infected bats and was occasionally demonstrated in this tissue alone, it is suggested that brown adipose tissue provides a mechanism by which these animals may serve as reservoirs for this agent in nature. The possibility that similar mechanisms may be involved in the maintenance of other viral agents during interepidemic periods is discussed.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Adipose Tissue","Rabies"],"pmid":"13835624","title":"Studies on the pathogenesis of rabies in insectivorous bats.

{"abstractText":"The Pasteur and Crabtree effects demonstrate that changes at the beginning of the metabolic sequence for glucose metabolism give rise to effects at the end, and vice versa. We have presented here three additional responses of the ascites tumor cell suspensions, and presumably more will be uncovered. Each one of these responses is a manifestation of factors in the underlying mechanism that are in the nature of chemical feedback of a linear or nonlinear nature. The metabolic reactions are sufficiently complex that it is unlikely that any single component or step need control metabolism in different types of cells or under all conditions for a particular cell. However, it is due to a favorable circumstance that, in an appropriate type of cell and with the use of a direct intracellular indicator for changes in ADP concentration, we can state that the respiratory metabolism of the ascites tumor cell suspension, as freshly withdrawn from the mouse abdomen, is limited by the intracellular ADP concentration, and that this is why these cells show a predominance of glycolytic over respiratory activity. The response of the metabolism to small and large additions of glucose illustrates aspects of the metabolic mechanism which involve control of endogenous metabolism and compartmentalization of ATP formed in oxidative phosphorylation, the net result being a depression of the respiratory activity.

{"abstractText":"Rabbit antibody + complement alters the permeability properties of mouse Krebs ascites tumor cells and erythrocytes. When antibody + C' acts on ascites tumor cells in a low protein medium, intracellular K(+) is lost from the cells at a rate far greater than the normal leak rate. At the same time the cells lose amino acids and ribonucleotides and become fully permeable to the Na(+) of the medium. When antibody + C' acts in a low protein medium, the cells swell extensively and lose most of their macromolecules to the medium (hemoglobin from erythrocytes, protein and RNA from the ascites tumor cells). If the antibody + C' acts in a medium containing protein in sufficient concentration to balance the colloid osmotic pressure of the cells, the swelling is prevented; no macromolecules are then lost from the cells, but the loss of K(+) and entrance of Na(+) are not altered, and the loss of amino acids and ribonucleotides is only slightly affected. It therefore appears that the action of antibody + C' is to produce functional \"holes\" in the animal cell membrane which permit the equilibration of cations and small molecules between cell and medium. This leads to an increase in the osmotic pressure of the cell and a rapid influx of water.

{"abstractText":"The isolation of carbohydrate variants from cultures of HeLa and conjunctival cells was described. Factors inherent in the cell culture system, such as parent populations and dialyzed serums, have been shown to influence the outcome of variant isolations. Established stable variants incorporated significantly more pentoses or lactate into various cell fractions than the parent cultures. Besides their abilities to propagate continuously in the selecting environments, the variants multiplied slower, were more susceptible to sub-zero preservation and the cytotoxic effect of D-2-deoxyglucose, showed lower cloning efficiencies and were less susceptible to the deleterious effect of glucose oxidase. The ribose variants also differed from the parent cultures in morphological appearance such as formation of multinucleated cells and ring-shaped colonies. They converted more ribose into other component sugars of mucopolysaccharides than the parent cultures. Preliminary analyses of the mucopolysaccharides extracted from the ribose variants and parent cultures showed large difference in their carbohydrate (Molisch-positive materials) and DNA ratios.

{"abstractText":"Fractionation procedures yielding partially purified vaccine preparations from a 60 degrees C. methanol extract of tubercle bacilli have been described. Some of the preparations have the characteristics of lipopolysaccharides. Certain ones have been found capable of increasing resistance to experimental tuberculosis in albino mice of the Rockefeller Swiss strain. The levels of resistance elicited by these preparations are equivalent to those following vaccination with BCG (Phipps) in this strain of mice as reported by other authors. The admixture of two of the crude fractions in amounts as small as 0.05 mg. each per dose per mouse affords an even greater increase in resistance. Neither of these substances alone in larger doses can approach this degree of efficacy in mouse protection experiments. The protective activity appears to involve the stimulation of two supplementary mechanisms, one providing a peak resistance between 1 and 3 weeks post vaccination but falling off to a lower level thereafter, the other not responding fully until approximately 6 weeks but continuing undiminished through a 12 week post-vaccination period. The first of these peaks corresponds to an increase in resistance against staphylococci as well as tubercle bacilli.

Homogeneous suspensions of leucocytes were disrupted by lysis in 0.34 M sucrose. This procedure liberated the cytoplasmic contents of the cell and dissolved a considerable proportion of the nuclei. Following disruption, the sucrose lysate was separated into three fractions by differential centrifugation, i.e. 400 g or nuclear pellet, 8,200 g or granule pellet and the postgranule supernate. Microscopic examination revealed that the 8,200 g pellet was composed of intact granules as well as occasional mitochondria. The other two fractions were morphologically heterogeneous. Studies with isolated granules demonstrated their lysis by a variety of weak acids and surface-active agents. When buffered solutions were employed between the ranges of pH 2.0 and 9.0, granule lysis began at pH 5.5 and was complete at pH 4.0. Chemical analysis disclosed that the granule pellet contained protein and phospholipid with only traces of nucleic acids. Approximately 70 to 80 per cent of the total cellular antimicrobial agent phagocytin was present in the granule fraction. This material was liberated from the granules by acid (pH 5.0 or lower). Studies on selected enzymes showed that acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, nucleotidase, ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, and beta glucuronidase were predominantly localized in the granule fraction. Approximately 50 per cent of total cellular lysozyme and cathepsin were also present in the 8,200 g pellet.

{"abstractText":"The phagocytosis and intracellular destruction of bacteria by rabbit polymorphonuclear leucocytes has been studied in vitro under defined conditions. The efficient and continuing ingestion of bacteria was dependent upon (a) opsonic factors present in fresh rabbit serum as well as upon, (b) the availability of an adequate supply of glucose in the medium. The effects of selected enzymatic inhibitors on the metabolic and functional activities of the leucocytes was investigated. Cyanide which inhibited oxygen consumption had no effect on the ingestion or inactivation of bacteria, Iodoacetate and arsenite which blocked glycolysis produced a marked inhibition in particle ingestion. 2,4-Dinitrophenol which stimulated both oxygen consumption and glycolysis, depressed phagocytosis after a 1 hour latent period. It was concluded that phagocytosis was an energy-requiring process in which glycolysis served as the most important source of energy. Leucocytes which were ingesting heat-killed bacteria exhibited increases in oxygen consumption, glucose utilization, and lactic acid synthesis.

Employing a 500-fold range of concentration (0.1 to 50.0 microg.\/ml.), it was shown that endotoxin enhanced the rate at which staphylococci were killed by leucocytes. The mechanism underlying the increased killing was found to be a direct stimulation of the phagocytic activity of the leucocyte and not mediated by the release of bactericidins or opsonins from the treated cells. In the presence of 10 per cent serum all concentrations of endotoxin enhanced phagocytosis, whereas at lower serum concentrations, the higher doses of lipopolysaccharide inhibited the phagocytic activity of the cells. Similar concentrations of endotoxin were capable of increasing the utilization of glucose and the production of lactic acid. Endotoxin treated leucocytes exhibited no change in oxygen consumption, and only a slight depression in glycogen synthesis.

{"abstractText":"The phagocytosis and survival of staphylococci in the presence of rabbit macrophages has been studied quantitatively. The method permitted an independent measurement to be made of intracellular and extracellular bacteria during the course of phagocytosis. It was found that S. aureus was relatively resistant to phagocytosis. In the presence of specific immune serum, however, it was ingested at a rate comparable with that of S. albus in normal serum; under these conditions more than 90 per cent of bacteria of either strain were inactivated within 60 minutes. Since immune serum did not alter the susceptibility of S. aureus to inactivation within macrophages, it is concluded that S. aureus and S. albus are similar in respect to their ability to survive within macrophages. The inactivation of staphylococci occurred more slowly, and a greater percentage survived incubation for 180 minutes, in macrophages than in polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Moreover, they retained their morphology for many hours within the former cell, but disappeared rapidly from the cytoplasm of granulocytes. It is suggested that the antibacterial mechanisms of the two cell types are fundamentally different. When studied over a prolonged period the staphylococci which survived early inactivation within macrophages were observed to die slowly over many hours. When they were recovered from cells and exposed to fresh macrophages, however, they were ingested and inactivated as readily as bacteria of the original population. It is suggested, therefore, that the prolonged survival in vitro of some staphylococci is due to variation in the efficiency of the antibacterial mechanism of exudative mononuclear phagocytes.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Phagocytosis","Staphylococcus"],"pmid":"13764872","title":"The phagocytosis and inactivation of staphylococci by macrophages of normal rabbits.","year":"1960"},

{"abstractText":"Study of the capsular genome of pneumococcus has shown that it controls a multiplicity of biochemical reactions essential to the synthesis of capsular polysaccharide. Mutation affecting any one of several biochemical reactions concerned with capsular synthesis may result in loss of capsulation without alteration of other biochemical functions similarly concerned. Mutations affecting the synthesis of uronic acids are an important cause of loss of capsulation and of virulence by strains of pneumococcus Type I and Type III. The capsular genome appears to have a specific location in the total genome of the cell, this locus being occupied by the capsular genome of whatever capsular type is expressed by the cell. Transformation of capsulated or of non-capsulated pneumococci to heterologous capsular type results probably from a genetic exchange followed by the development of a new biosynthetic pathway in the transformed cell. The new capsular genome is transferred to the transformed cell as a single particle of DNA. Binary capsulation results from the simultaneous presence within the pneumococcal cell of two capsular genomes, one mutated, the other normal. Interaction between the biochemical pathways controlled by the two capsular genomes leads to augmentation of the phenotypic expression of the product controlled by one and to partial suppression of the product determined by the other.

The incubation of cartilaginous rudiments from 7-day chick embryos in a solution containing papain and cysteine resulted in complete loss of the metachromasia of the cartilage matrix within 1 hour; explants treated in this fashion recovered normal metachromatic staining properties when grown in normal medium for 4 days. The incubation of 7-day chick cartilage rudiments in a solution containing papain without cysteine resulted in partial loss of metachromasia from cartilage within 1 hour; the addition of vitamin A to the solution did not enhance the effect of papain during this period. The addition of papain to the culture medium in which 7-day chick embryo cartilage rudiments were grown resulted in uniform loss of the metachromasia of the cartilage matrix; similar explants grown in the presence of excess vitamin A also showed loss of the metachromasia of cartilage, but certain regions of the cartilage were affected earlier and more severely than others. Changes in cartilage cells, including loss of glycogen, occurred when the rudiment was grown in medium containing excess vitamin A, but not when it was grown in the presence of papain. Bone rudiments from 13-day chick embryos showed changes in cartilage similar to those seen in 7-day chick embryo rudiments when grown in the presence of papain or of excess vitamin A; the existing bone was not affected under these conditions. When grown in the presence of papain or excess vitamin A, the cartilage of late fetal mouse bone underwent changes similar to those already described in chick embryo rudiments. In contrast to the chick embryo rudiments, those from the fetal mouse showed rapid resorption of bone when grown in the presence of excess vitamin A. Papain had no effect on bone from either source. The changes seen in cartilage of explants grown in the presence of vitamin A and papain together were greater than those seen with either agent alone. The changes seen in fetal mouse bone grown in the presence of vitamin A were not enhanced by the additional presence of papain. On the basis of these observations, it is suggested that the changes in cartilage seen in experimental hypervitaminosis A may be the result of activation of a proteolytic enzyme or enzymes with properties similar to papain.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Bone and Bones","Cartilage","Papain","Vitamin A"],"pmid":"13698767","title":"Comparison of the effects of papain and vitamin A on cartilage.

The effect was attributable to strong anticomplementary activity, 5 to 15 times greater than that of other organs. Inactivation of complement by kidney tissue was found to have characteristics of a chemical reaction, the active principle being heat-labile, non-dialysable, and difficult to separate from tissue particles. Attempts to purify it or to obtain it in a soluble form usually resulted in great loss in activity. The component of complement affected was the fourth; i.e., that which is characterized by susceptibility to injury by ammonia. Similarities were found to exist between the conditions of ammonia formation and complement inactivation by kidney homogenates, the most notable being enhancement by phosphate and glutamine.

The purported preferential reactivity of Z with the third component of C' (C'(3)) is not supported by the present experiments in which Z was reacted with C' in both guinea pig and human sera. Approximately the same number of reactive units of C'(1, 4) and of C'(3) were inactivated by Z, as well as by D. pneumoniae and a washed specific precipitate of bovine albumin-anti-albumin. The latter evidence that small amounts of antigen-antibody complex fix significant amounts of C'(3) stands in contrast with the classical concept that C'(3) is not fixed in ordinary complement fixation reaction.

On second passage or with smaller initial inocula no CPE became apparent. The viruses multiplied, however, as determined by titrations in HeLa cultures or chick embryos. Indeed, persistently infected sublines of MCN and Lung-To were readily established without resort to special manipulations and some of these have been carried now for over 18 months on the same media and schedules as the uninfected parent strains. The viruses were found to be associated mainly with the cells and only 1, or at most 10 per cent of it was detectable in the media. The titers obtained were always low in relation to the available cell population. Reduction or even omission of the horse serum component in the media or ultraviolet irradiation of the cultures did not increase the yield of virus, and CPE became apparent only when similarly treated, uninfected cultures were, likewise, affected by the manipulations. The persistently infected cultures differed from their uninfected counterparts in that they exhibited (a) decreased cellular growth rates and ultimate yields; (b) increased aerobic glycolysis; and (c) a high degree of resistance to cytopathogenic viruses, influenza A (PR8), herpes simplex and, especially vesicular stomatitis (VSV) viruses. Prolonged treatment of persistently infected cultures by addition of specific antiviral immune sera to the media reduced significantly the amount of virus present and the degree of resistance to VSV. However, upon removal of the sera after as many as 187 days of treatment the viruses reappeared in all but one instance. The cured culture, on reinfection, became again persistently infected. No evidence was obtained to indicate genetic inhomogeneity of the cell populations. Of 50 cloned MCN lines none was destroyed by NDV and all became persistently infected.

Whereas the former yielded only plaques on monolayers of chick embryo fibroblasts which were of pin-point size and hazy, those obtained with the latter were rarely of this type and mostly large and clear.

It was shown by 4 different technics that only between 10 and less than 1 per cent of the cells yield infectious virus, depending upon the agent employed and, possibly, variations in the conditions of the cultures. No evidence was found to indicate production of non-infectious virus materials. Only the cells carrying infectious virus are capable upon transfer to uninfected cultures to transmit the infection. Cells from persistently infected cultures, which are free of infectious virus at the time of transfer, failed to liberate virus at a later time during incubation periods of up to 4 weeks. The virus-producing cells contain at any given moment not more than 1 infectious unit of virus, suggesting a linear mode of production; i.e., as soon as a virus particle is completed, it is released. Upon inoculation of MCN test tube cultures with chick embryo-adapted NDV persistent infection and interference with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is established with considerable delay. In contrast, following transfer of MCN-adapted NDV, in form of MCN(NDV) cells or first allantoic passage seeds derived therefrom, the number of virus-producing cells increases logarithmically, doubling every 6 to 8 hours until a total of about 10(4) is reached. Thereafter their numbers rise in proportion to the increase in total cell population; i.e., doubling approximately every 48 hours. At the time when 10(4) virus-producing cells are present in the culture interference with VSV is solidly established. In order to obtain this result about 10(6) cells must have adsorbed virus particles, or, in other words, at least 10(6) virus units must have totally been produced instead of the 10(4) measured by infectivity assay.

Variations in the cellular site (cytoplasm, cell membrane, and nucleus), the distribution (particulate or homogeneous), and the quantity (little or much) of Rous viral antigens were seen. The per cent of sarcoma cells containing viral antigens was related to the tumor initiating dose of virus and to the infectivity titer of virus extracted from the wing tumor. With certain assumptions it was estimated that a quantity of virus approaching one tumor-producing dose (1 TD(50)) per tissue section was detectable with fluorescent antibody. Sarcoma cells containing viral antigens were identified as early as 4 days after inoculation of Rous virus. At this time viral antigens were also localized in the skeletal muscle of the inoculated wing in a characteristic focal pattern of deposition near or on the sarcolemma. This association between viral antigens and skeletal muscle fibers was observed also at 3 days after virus inoculation, when sarcoma cells were not yet demonstrable in the tissue sections.

{"abstractText":"The lathyrogenic agents, beta-aminopropionitrile and semicarbizide, when applied to the chorio-allantoic membrane of the chick embryo produced a dramatic increase in fragility of the embryo. This alteration was not associated with a change in the concentration of collagen, except in aorta, but was accompanied by a sharp increase in the amount of collagen extractible in cold 1 M NaCl from skin, bone, and aorta. Increase in fragility and extractible collagen began within 3 hours after introduction of the agent and rose steadily for at least 72 hours. Essentially no collagen could be extracted from tissues of normal chick embryos. Both fragility and amount of extractible collagen were dosage- and time-dependent. It is concluded that the extractible collagen in lathyrism consists of a large proportion of dissolved fibers previously insoluble and formed prior to administration of the agent. The data also suggest that the \"lathyritic\" collagen in vivo is not in molecular dispersion but in an aggregate or fibrillar form. It is dispersed by cooling. The extracted collagen could be reconstituted to typical striated fibrils in vitro and the molecule appeared to be normal in the gross, with regard to asymmetry ratio and intramolecular helical structure.

The majority of intracytoplasmic viral particles were within walled vacuoles. It is suggested that this strain of virus differentiates and frequently crystallizes at template sites which are characterized by aggregates of granules near the nuclear margin; that particles, either singly or occasionally in small groups, become enclosed by a second peripheral membrane while still within the nucleus; that the virus can pass into the cytoplasm through reduplications of the nuclear membrane which are deposited behind the virus in such a manner as to prevent rupture of the nucleus; that most of the intracytoplasmic virus is contained within sacks formed by nuclear membranes; and that rupture of these sacks at the cell surface results in extrusion of virus without disruption of the cell.

During the latent period, the infected cells were suspended, diluted, and distributed under oil into droplets each containing a single cell, as checked by microscopic observation. The virus particles released by individual cells into the microdrop were characterized in differential plaque neutralization tests. Fifteen per cent of the microdrops contained doubly neutralizable particles, 53 per cent yielded either CA9 or E7 particles, and 34 yielded particles of an intermediate character (deficits between 37 and 75 per cent). On passage, the doubly neutralizable particles yielded progeny of both parental types. All passage strains behaved like the corresponding parent strain as regards pathogenicity for newborn mice, which is to say that this property was limited to virus particles with CA9 antigenicity.

{"abstractText":"Capsulated transformants producing type II polysaccharide have been obtained by reactions between a number of R mutants of type II pneumococcus. All the IIR strains except II-R36 yielded extracts which transformed 2 VIIIR strains to VIIIS. Two of the IIR strains were transformed to VIIIS by an extract of 1 VIIIR strain. The most striking result was the production of both IIS and VIIIS transformants by the action of extracts of both VIIIR strains applied to cells of II-RB. This suggests that the determination of capsular type in pneumococcus does not depend on single allelomorphic genes; it seems more likely that a number of genes may be required to determine type specificity, and that some genes may be common to different types, possibly in connection with common biochemical pathways for some stages of polysaccharide synthesis. This is further indicated by the finding that extracts of capsulated strains of each of the types I, II, III, VII, VIII, XIV, and XVIII are capable of giving IIS transformants with 1 or more of the IIR strains in addition to the expected donor-type transformants. Strain II-R36 was transformed by extracts of all S types except type VII, but the only transformants found were of the donor type.

{"abstractText":"Mouse polyoma virus was stored at 4 degrees and -60 degrees C. for 8 weeks without any loss in hemagglutination or infectivity titer; storage at 37 degrees for 8 weeks reduced infectivity titer by approximately 2.5 log(10) units. Repeated freezing and thawing of infectious tissue culture fluid had no effect on virus titer. The stability of the virus to storage for 1 week at 4 degrees C. was unaffected by suspension of infected tissue culture fluid in saline, demineralized distilled water, or 5 per cent horse serum in Eagle's basal medium. Heating the virus for 30 minutes at 60 degrees C. had no effect on infectivity and hemagglutination titers. Heating at 65 degrees C. for 30 minutes produced a 3 log unit loss of infectivity and a 4-fold decline in HA titer, and heating at 70 degrees C. for 30 minutes usually produced complete inactivation of infectivity and HA. The virus was resistant to ultraviolet irradiation; ultraviolet irradiation for 2 hours caused a 4 log unit decrease in infectivity titer without affecting the HA titer. The virus was resistant to exposure to 2 per cent phenol and 50 per cent ethyl alcohol but was inactivated by 100 per cent ethyl alcohol, and ethyl alcohol-iodine mixtures. Lyophilization had no effect on the stability of the virus.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Viruses"],"pmid":"13641568","title":"Studies of mouse polyoma virus infection.

{"abstractText":"Eight mouse colonies were surveyed for prevalence of antibody to mouse polyoma virus. Frequency of HI antibody varied from 0 to 84 per cent in adult mice in different colonies. Antibody was infrequent in mice less than 3 months of age, and increased in frequency with age. There was no evidence that infection was specific for particular mouse strains. The highest frequency of infection was found in colonies in which breeding mice are housed in proximity to mice inoculated with polyoma virus or passage tumors, and within an infected colony, the incidence of infection was greatest in rooms housing mice inoculated with polyoma virus. Mice from a colony free of antibody became infected when held in room or cage contact with virus-inoculated mice, but at very low rates except in mothers of inoculated litters. These results were interpreted as indicating that artificial contamination of the environment is an important factor in determining the prevalence of infection in the colonies observed. There was no correlation between polyoma infection and spontaneous leukemia in AK. mice.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Virus Diseases"],"pmid":"13641569","title":"Studies of mouse polyoma virus infection.

{"abstractText":"Histologic changes occurring in the rabbit spleen during the primary response to intravenous injection of bovine gamma globulin alone and in combination with bacterial endotoxin have been described. The predominant morphologic changes associated with antibody formation in animals that received antigen alone were confined to the follicular areas of the spleen. Only minimal changes were seen in the red pulp. No new cellular types appeared following endotoxin stimulus. Rather, a profound augmentation of events observed following a single injection of bovine gamma globulin alone appears to account for the higher levels of antibody incited by this adjuvant. The cell type important in antibody formation under these conditions appeared to be a modified reticular cell. Plasma cells were not part of the cellular reaction. A hypothesis describing the primary antibody response is presented.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Antibodies","Spleen"],"pmid":"13641570","title":"Studies on the adjuvant action of bacterial endotoxins on antibody formation.

{"abstractText":"Primary or established strain cultures of a variety of primate cells that were susceptible to cytopathic infection strongly adsorbed poliovirus. Insusceptible non-primate cells in primary or established-strain culture did not so adsorb virus (or propagate it), with exception of the ERK-1 embryo rabbit kidney strain. All tested cells, regardless of type or susceptibility, adsorbed about 1 per cent of input virus, which became cell-associated (CAV) without loss of infectivity. In combination with susceptible or insusceptible cells, CAV was only about 90 per cent neutralized by homotypic antiserum. CAV eluted continuously from non-susceptible cells with continued incubation; eluted virus gave rise to infection and new CAV to the same degree in susceptible cells as did original virus.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Poliovirus"],"pmid":"13641571","title":"The mammalian cell-virus relationship.

{"abstractText":"Phases of attachment, reception or penetration, and eclipse of Type 1 poliovirus infecting HeLa cells in monolayer were studied. Firm attachment was not completely dependent on salt concentration, and was sensitive to temperature change. Like attachment, progressive resistance of adsorbed virus to inactivation by externally applied antibody was temperature-sensitive. Penetration was shown to be independent of physiologic integrity of cells. Virus in process of penetration was not affected by ribonuclease. Eclipse of adsorbed virus was not dependent on metabolic activity or physical integrity of HeLa cells. Debris from poliovirus-susceptible cells inactivated the virus in a manner similar to the kinetic course of virus adsorption by intact cells, and released cell-associated infective virus in similar amounts. All cells insusceptible to poliovirus infection failed to yield active debris. Virus inactivation by debris, like virus reception by intact cells, was temperature-sensitive. Debris could not inactivate virus adsorbed to cells, or alter the progressive incapacity of antibody to neutralize penetrating virus. The active debris factor was insoluble, was not associated with cell nuclei, was inactivated by fat solvents and trypsin treatment, and was destroyed by beat inactivation or sonic disruption. Anti-HeLa serum applied to cells before exposure to virus reduced the rate of virus adsorption, while antiserum treatment immediately following virus adsorption was ineffective. These findings suggested that the capacity of HeLa and other susceptible cells to adsorb, receive, and eclipse poliovirus was associated with organized cytoplasmic lipoprotein structures not possessed by insusceptible cells. The reaction of virus with receptor substance contained in debris was not readily reversed by treatment shown not to affect virus and to destroy activity of uncombined debris. Sensitivity of poliovirus adsorption by HeLa cells to change in environmental salt concentration or temperature was dependent on the method of measurement.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Poliovirus"],"pmid":"13641572","title":"The mammalian cell-virus relationship.

It is also a highly active inhibitor of pock formation by vaccinia and herpes simplex viruses on the chorioallantoic membrane in vivo. Marked inhibitory effects were obtained with 12.5 microg. of RNase. However, complete inhibition was not obtained with several hundred micrograms of the enzyme. RNase caused no inactivation of the infectivity of vaccinia virus particles but it had a marked inhibitory effect on multiplication of this virus when administered many hours after infection of host cells had occurred. RNase also failed to inactivate the infectivity of herpes simplex virus particles. The results obtained indicate that ribonucleic acid is necessary for the multiplication of two DNA-containing viruses; i.e., vaccinia and herpes simplex.","journal":"The Journal of experimental medicine","meshMajor":["Herpesviridae Infections","RNA","Ribonucleases","Vaccinia"],"pmid":"13775110","title":"On the role of ribonucleic acid in animal virus synthesis.

{"abstractText":"Localized membrane current and potential measurements were made on the squid giant axon in voltage clamp experiments. Spatial control of potential was impaired by the use of axial current supplying electrodes with surface resistance greater than 20 ohms for a centimeter length of axon. No region of membrane which was indeed subjected to a potential step showed more than one inward current peak. Other patterns were results of space clamp failure. Membrane current and potential patterns during space clamp failure were approximately reproduced in computations on a model containing two membrane patches obeying the equations of Hodgkin and Huxley. Non-uniformities in the axon or electrodes are not necessary for non-uniform electrical behavior. An extension of the core conductor model which includes the axial wire and external solution has been analyzed. The space constant of electrotonic spread is less than 0.5 mm with a usable electrode. Errors of about 5 per cent are introduced by ignoring the external solution. Resistance between the membrane and the control electrodes reduces the control and a few ohm cm(2) could lead to serious errors in interpretation.","journal":"Biophysical journal","meshMajor":["Neurons"],"pmid":"13775643","title":"Analysis of certain errors in squid axon voltage clamp measurements.","year":"1960"}]}
