# Question-Answering-System
Implemented Question Answering System using following steps: 
1. Implemented vector space model to keep track of all the unique terms and their counts 
2. Used TF-IDF and cosine similarity to check the most similar documents as per question. 
3. Implemented a basic summarizer to summarize the answers after processing the question whether its factoid ( yes/no, time etc) or detailed question.
